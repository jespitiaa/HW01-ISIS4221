       "['william beaumont and the human digestion.  william beaumont: physiology of digestion image source.  on november 21, 1785, us american surgeon william beaumont was born. he became best known as “father of gastric physiology” following his research on human digestion. william beaumont was born in lebanon, connecticut and became a physician. he served as a surgeon’s mate in the army during the war of 1812. he opened a private practice in plattsburgh, new york, but rejoined the army as a surgeon in 1819. beaumont was stationed at fort mackinac on mackinac island in michigan in the early 1820s when it existed to protect the interests of the american fur company. the fort became the refuge for a wounded 19-year old french canadian fur trader named alexis st. martin when a shotgun went off by accident in the american fur company store at close range june 6th, 1822. st. martin’s wound was quite serious because his stomach was perforated and several ribs were broken. nobody really expected that the young man would survive but he really did. the skin around st. martin’s wound fused to the hole in his stomach, leaving a permanent opening – a gastric fistula.  beaumont quickly noticed that there was much research potential. back then, not too much was known about the digestive system. in order to gain more information, beaumont performed numerous experiments on st. martin over a period of eight years. the experiments must have been really uncomfortable for the man, who was inserted bits of different foods tied to strings through the hole in his stomach, pulling them out periodically to observe digestion. beaumont also removed gastric juice, examining it to better understand its nature. beaumont became the “father of gastric physiology” and his findings were published in the book “experiments and observations on the gastric juice and the physiology of digestion” in 1833. the work is now considered as the basis of much of the early knowledge on digestion. william beaumont discovered that hydrochloric acid is the main chemical responsible for breaking down food and he suggested that another important digestive chemical, which is now known as pepsin. he suggested that digestion is a chemical process, not merely a mechanical one caused by stomach muscle movement. also, beaumont gave insights on how emotions, temperature, and physical activity can affect digestion. beaumont’s famous patient, st. martin, outlived the scientist even though his wound never completely healed. he had several children and died at the age of 83.  at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture on the digestive system.\\n',\n",
       " 'selma lagerlöf and the wonderful adventures of niels holgersson.  cover of the wonderful adventures of nils.  on november 20, 1858, swedish author and nobel laureate selma lagerlöf was born. she is best known for her children’s book ‘the wonderful adventures of nils‘. moreover, she was the first female writer to win the nobel prize in literature. selma lagerlöf attended a teachers college in stockholm and became a teacher at the girls’ secondary school in landskrona. lagerlöf had been writing poetry for a long time, but never published anything until 1890. she received the first prize in a literary competition and began publishing excerpts from the book which was to be her first, best, and most popular work. gösta berlings saga was published in 1891, but went unnoticed until its danish translation received wide critical acclaim and paved the way for the book‘s lasting success in sweden and elsewhere. she received financial support from the royal family and the swedish academy, which enabled her to give up teaching completely and focus on writing. lagerlöf traveled to italy and published ‘the miracles of antichrist‘ in 1897, followed by ‘jerusalem‘ in 1900. however, to her most famous books belongs the book ‘nils holgerssons underbara resa genom sverige‘, published in 1906.  the book starts out with the young nils holgersson, who takes delight in hurting the animals at his family’s farm. the boy catches a tomte while his family is out at church and nils, who refuses to let the tomte free is turned into a tomte as well. the shrunken boy is now able to talk to the farm animals, who are delighted to see nils being so tiny and they seek revenge. meanwhile, wild geese are flying over the farm and a white farm goose attempts to join them. nils holds on to the bird’s neck as it successfully takes off and joins the wild birds. those are not too pleased to be joined by a boy and a domestic goose, but they take both on several adventures across sweden. the goose and nils have to accomplish several tasks in order to be accepted by the group. also, nils learns that the tomte might change him back to regular size, if he did good.  the story around nils’ adventures became so well known in sweden, that a picture of nils holgersson, on the back of a goose flying over the plains of scania, was printed on the reverse side of the swedish 20 krona banknote. several film adaptations have been produced all over the world and even a very successful anime series was produced. at yovisto, you may be interested in the video ‘pixar – a human story of computer animation‘\\n',\n",
       " 'ferdinand de lesseps and the suez canal.  ferdinand marie, vicomte de lesseps (1805-1894).  on november 19, 1805, french diplomat and later developer of the suez canal ferdinand marie, vicomte de lesseps was born. the suez canal that was constructed under de lessep‘s supervision in 1869 joined the mediterranean and red seas, substantially reducing sailing distances and times between the west and the east. ferdinand de lesseps was born at versailles, yvelines, in 1805 into a family of french career diplomats. his first years were spent in italy, where his father was occupied with his consular duties. he was educated at the college of henry iv in paris. from the age of 18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department of the army. from 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice consul at lisbon, where his uncle, barthélemy de lesseps, was the french chargé d’affaires. this uncle was an old companion of french explorer jean françois de la pérouse and the only survivor of the expedition in which la pérouse perished. following the profession of his father, ferdinand de lesseps during his early career was posted to tunisia and egypt. in 1832 de lesseps was appointed vice consul at alexandria. fortunately for de lesseps, mehemet ali, the viceroy of egypt, owed his position in part to the recommendations made on his behalf to the french government by mathieu de lesseps, who was consul general in egypt when ali was a colonel. because of this, de lesseps received a warm welcome from the viceroy and became good friends with his son, said pasha. de lesseps became fascinated with the cultures of the mediterranean and middle east and the growth of western european trade. after postings to spain and italy, in 1849 he retired after a disagreement with the french government, and never again occupied any public office. in 1854, de lessep’s friend said pasha became the new viceroy of egypt. de lesseps immediately returned to egypt, where he was given a warm welcome and, soon afterwards, permission to begin work on the suez canal for which he had been inspired by reading about napoleon‘s abandoned plans for a canal that would allow large ships wishing to sail to the east to go directly from the mediterranean to the red sea, thereby cutting out the long sea journey around africa. on 7 november 1854 de lesseps landed at alexandria a first scheme, directed by lesseps, was immediately drawn up by the surveyors linant bey and mougel bey providing for direct communication between the mediterranean and red sea, and, after being slightly modified, it was adopted by an international commission of engineers in 1856. the compagnie universelle du canal maritime de suez was organized at the end of 1858. on 25 april 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by de lesseps at port said. during the following ten years, de lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the british government preventing the sultan from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, empress eugenie, to persuade the emperor napoleon iii to act as arbitrator in the disputes. finally, on 17 november 1869, the canal was officially opened by the khedive, ismail pasha. despite several futile trials, de lesseps had failed to get also support for his project by the british government. british attitudes finally changed when the canal was seen to be a success and de lesseps was treated as a great celebrity on his subsequent visit to britain. in 1875, the egyptian government sold its shares in the canal and the british prime minister, benjamin disraeli, bought effective control of the canal company. in his 74th year, de lesseps began to plan a new canal in panama. in 1879, an international congress was held in paris, which chose the route for the panama canal and appointed de lesseps as leader of the undertaking. however, the decision to dig a panama canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporary medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project. the panama canal company declared itself bankrupt in december 1888 and entered liquidation in february 1889. the failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the panama canal scandal, after rumors circulated that french politicians and journalists had received bribes. a french court found de lesseps and his son charles guilty of mismanagement. both were heavily fined and sentenced to imprisonment. in the event, de lesseps did not go to jail, but his son paid for his elderly father’s misjudgements with a year in prison. de lesseps died on 7 december 1894. at yovisto you can learn more about the work on the suez

       " 'walt disney’s ‘steamboat willie’ and the rise of mickey mouse.  mickey mouse star in walk of fame image by flickr user freshwater2006.  on november 18, 1928, walt disney’s animated movie ‘steamboat willie‘ was released that presented his most famous character ‘mickey mouse‘ for the very first time in new york city. the film is also notable for being the first cartoon with synchronized sound. the movie was produced in black and white and debuts mickey mouse as well as his girlfriend minnie. even though it was the third of mickey’s films to be produced, it was the first to be distributed. the movie starts out with mickey steering a river steamboat until the boat’s real captain pete appears, who orders mickey off the bridge. mickey and pete then proceed to fight back and forth on the ship while they accidentally trip and fall. eventually, minnie appears on board and the two mice proceed to make music together using the animals aboard. meanwhile, pete gets angry again, ordering mickey to peel the potatoes. a parrot appears, who makes fun of the mouse and mickey throws a potato at him, which knocks the parrot into the river. oswald the lucky rabbit used to be the star of disney’s and he was one of the first cartoon characters that had personality. however, disney lost the rights to the character and mickey mouse was intended to become the new star. the first films starring mickey mouse were silent films and did not really impress the audiences. no distributor was found and disney came to realize that adding sound to a cartoon would probably increase its appeal. however, steamboat willie was not the first cartoon synchronized sound. dave and max fleischer’s inkwell studios produced 19 sound cartoons in the mid 1920s using the phonofilm sound on film process. unfortunately, the sound could not be synchronized completely. steamboat willie was produced using a click track to keep his musicians on the beat. back then, click track meant that optical marks were made on the film to indicate precise timings for musical accompaniment. initially, the producers had doubts about the sound in a cartoon and disney arranged a test screening with a small audience consisting of disney employees and their wives. the live sound accompanied the partly finished film steamboat willie. behind the movie screen, a bed sheet was installed along with a microphone and speakers. the sound, consisting of a mouth organ, percussion and several ‘special effects‘ like bells and whistles, was produced from behind the sheet. the audience loved it and a company was hired to professionally produce the sound system as well as the green brothers novelty band for the final soundtrack. steamboat willie premiered at universal’s colony theater in new york city on november 18, 1928 and was an instant success which caused walt disney and mickey mouse international fame. at yovisto, you may be interested in the lecture ‘the power of cartoons‘ by patrick chappatte.\\n',\n",
       " 'eugene wigner and the structure of the atomic nucleus.  eugene paul wigner (1902-1995). on november 17, 1902, hungarian american theoretical physicist and mathematician eugene paul wigner was born. he is best known for for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles for which he shared the 1963 nobel prize in physics with maria goeppert. wigner’s thesis bildung und zerfall von molekülen (“formation and decay of molecules”) was supervised by michael polanyi and contains the first theory of the rates of association and dissociation of molecules. having completed his doctorate, wigner returned to budapest to join his father’s tannery firm as planned. however, things did not go too well. wigner’s father supported him taking the post in berlin, where he accepted an offer from karl weissenberg at the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin. weissenberg wanted someone to assist him with his work on x ray crystallography, and polanyi had recommended wigner.  wigner received a request from arnold sommerfeld to work in göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician david hilbert. this proved a disappointment, as hilbert‘s interests had shifted to logic. wigner nonetheless studied independently. he laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the wigner d matrix. an offer to spend a term in princeton saw him travel to the united states at the end of 1930. from 1930 to 1933 wigner spent part of the year at princeton, part at berlin. his berlin post vanished under the nazi rules passed in 1933 and from then, except for the years 1936 - 1938 in wisconsin, wigner spent the rest of his career at princeton. in 1937, wigner became a naturalized citizen of the united states. in 1939, it was wigner, who introduced leó szilárd to albert einstein for a meeting that resulted in the einstein szilárd letter which urged president franklin d. roosevelt to initiate the manhattan project to develop atomic bombs. during the manhattan project, wigner led a team that was to design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into weapons gradeplutonium. at the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. in july1942, wigner chose a conservative 100 mw design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling, which led to the successful development of the world’s first atomic reactor, chicago pile one (cp 1) that achieved a nuclear chain reaction in 1942. in 1946, wigner accepted a position as director of research and development at clinton laboratory (now oak ridge national laboratory) in oak ridge, tenn. not an administrator by background or temperament, wigner left after a year and returned to teaching and research at princeton university. in 1963, wigner was awarded the nobel prize in physics, along with american physicist maria goeppert mayer and german physicist j. hans d. jensen, for work on the structure of the atomic nucleus. he professed to never have considered the possibility that this might occur, and he added: “i never expected to get my name in the newspapers without doing something wicked.” wigner also won the enrico fermi award in 1958, and the national medal of science in 1969. near the end of his life, wigner’s thoughts turned more philosophical. he became interested in the vedanta philosophy of hinduism, particularly its ideas of the universe as an all pervading consciousness. eugene paul wigner died in princeton on january 1, 1995. at yovisto, you may enjoy a short video lecture by tyler dewitt on the ‘atomic structure: discovery of the neutron‘\\n',\n",
       " 'eugenio beltrami and non euclidian geometry.  eugenio beltrami (1835-1900). on november 16, 1835, italian mathematician eugenio beltrami was born. he is most notable for his work concerning differential geometry and mathematical physics. his work was noted especially for clarity of exposition. he was the first to prove consistency of non euclidean geometry by modeling it on a surface of constant curvature, the pseudosphere. eugenio beltrami was born in cremona in lombardy, then a part of the austrian empire, and now part of italy. the son of an artist who painted miniatures, young eugenio certainly inherited artistic talents from his family, but in his case in addition to the mathematical talents he would acquire, it was musicrather than painting that became important in his life. he began studying mathematics at university of pavia in 1853, but was expelled from ghislieri college in 1856 due to his political opinions. during this time he was taught and influenced by francesco brioschi, who had been appointed as professor of applied mathematics at the university of pavia the year before beltrami began his studies. beltrami had to discontinue his studies because of financial hardship and spent the next several years as a secretary working for the lombardy–venice railroad company first in verona and later in milan. while beltrami was in milan the kingdom of italy was established in 1861, an important political event which did much to invigorate the academic scene in italy. beltrami began to work hard at his mathematical studies again and in 1862 he published his first paper. as a result, he was appointed to the university of bologna as a professor in 1862. in 1870, a new university of rome was set up in the new italian capital and beltrami was appointed to the chair of rational mechanics there in 1873. after three years in rome, beltrami moved to pavia to take up the chair of mathematical physics there. however, beltrami returned to rome in 1891 and spent his last years teaching there. he became the president of the accademia dei lincei in 1898 and, the following year, a senator of the kingdom. a lover of music, beltrami was interested in the relationship between mathematics and music. scher, circle limit iv, illustrating hyperbolic geometry in 1868 beltrami published two memoirs dealing with consistency and interpretations of non euclidean geometry of bolyai and lobachevsky. beltrami proposed that this geometry could be realized on a surface of constant negative curvature, a pseudosphere. for beltrami’s concept, lines of the geometry are represented by geodesics on the pseudosphere and theorems of non euclidean geometry can be proved within ordinary three dimensional euclidean space, and not derived in an axiomatic fashion, as lobachevsky and bolyai had done previously. already in 1840, minding already considered geodesic triangles on the pseudosphere and remarked that the corresponding “trigonometric formulas” are obtained from the corresponding formulas of spherical trigonometry by replacing the usual trigonometric functions with hyperbolic functions in the second memoir “fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature“, beltrami continued this logic and gave an abstract proof of equiconsistency of hyperbolic and euclidean geometry for any dimension. he accomplished this by introducing several models of non euclidean geometry that are now known as the beltrami–klein model, the poincaré disk model, and the poincaré half plane model, together with transformations that relate them. although today beltrami’s “essay” is recognized as very important for the development of non euclidean geometry, the reception at the time was less enthusiastic. beltrami also worked on optics, thermodynamics, elasticity, electricity and magnetism. his contributions to these topics appeared in the four volume work, opere matematiche (1902-20), published posthumously. at yovisto, you can learn more about non euclidian geometry in the history of mathematics lecture of professor n. j. wildberger “mathhist12 – non euclidian geometry“.\\n',\n",

[1,2, 3] bakelite had the advantage, that it could be molded quickly. also, it was known for its extraordinarily high resistance and thus, became a popular material for the emerging electrical and automobile industries. soon, bakelite was integrated in numerous areas of living. jewellery was made out of it as well as telephones, or even billiard balls (see picture above).  at yovisto, you may be interested in a talk by diana cohen on ‘tough truths about plastic pollution‘.\\n',\n",

(1740). an inward view of stonehenge from august 1722  after reading an account by antiquary and natural philosopher john aubrey, who lived about 70 years before stukeley, he began to develope a particular interest in the stonehenge and avebury monuments. he spent years surveying stonehenge and avebury and mapping the burials and earthworks around them. stukeley’s principal works, elaborate accounts of stonehenge and avebury, appeared in 1740 and 1743. these were supposed to be the first of a multi volume universal history. stukeley believed that these pre roman sites had been built by ‘celts‘, led by their priests, the druids. mixing speculation with evidence from ancient texts, he concluded that the celts were originally phoenician colonists, who had ‘civilized’ britain long before the romans arrived. stukeley painted a romantic but fictitious vision of the druids worshipping at stonehenge that has lasted to the present day. he proposed that the cults of the druids are based on an ancient patriarchial religion that also was the original religion of mankind. this had subsequently degenerated as idol worship had emerged. stukeley himself being a priest of the church of england, believed that the druids and the early christians were examples of this religion. interestingly, these views were widely and enthusiastically accepted in the late 18th century. stukeley perceived the entire prehistoric landscape as laid out in a sacred pattern with centres at stonehenge and avebury. the stone circles and earthworks at avebury he recognized as part of a larger figure inscribed in the landscape in the form of a serpent. stukeley saw serpents, and dragons (a variant form of the same creature, as are also “worms”), all over countryside and linked the image with the many local legends of dragons and dragon killers found throughout the britain. the places associated with the dragon legend appear always to coincide with sites of ancient sanctity. stukeley’s work on stonehenge was one of the first to attempt to date the monument. working with the renowned astronomer edmund halley, he proposed that the builders of stonehenge knew about magnetism, and had aligned the monument with magnetic north. stukeley used some incomplete data about the variation of the north magnetic pole despite his romantic theorizing, he was an excellent field archaeologist, and his surveys of the monuments in the 1720s remain of interest. his extensive antiquarian travels are recorded in itinerarium curiosum (1724observant itinerary”). besides his work on archeology, stukeley was one of the first learned gentlemen to be attracted to speculative freemasonry as well as a friend of isaac newton, about whom he wrote a memoir of his life in 1752. actually, this is one of the earliest sources for the story of the falling apple that inspired newton’s formulation of the theory of gravitation. artist, prolific writer and poet, architect, archaeologist, antiquarian, scientist, physician, clergyman, druid, musician, numismatist, traveller, genealogist, gardener and animal lover, william stukeley was all of these. after stukeleys death in 1765 it was not until the 19th century that archaeologists took up from where he had finished his work. at yovisto you can learn more about stonehenge in the lecture of prof. jeanne willette from otis college of art and design on “stonehenge”\\n',\n",
       " 'adolphe sax and the saxophone.  adolphe sax (1814-1894)  .  on november 6, 1814, belgian musical instrument designer and musician antoine joseph “adolphe” sax was born. besides playing flute and clarinet, he is well known for having invented the saxophone. sax became something of a footnote in history after his creation was almost forgotten after his death, until it was revived by jazz musicians who barely remembered his name. back in the time when i was a student, i remember one fellow student who ‘polluted’ the air of the student’s dorm for two long semesters with his (futile) practicing on that very instrument invented by gustave sax. i can tell you that it is really a pain to listen to a beginner’s trials on the saxophone. antoine joseph sax was born in dinant, belgium, as the oldest of 11 children to charles joseph sax, an instrument designer, who made several changes to the design of the horn. sax became his father’s apprentice and began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his flutes and a clarinet into a competition at the age of 15. he subsequently studied those two instruments at the royal conservatory of brussels. the saxtuba, one of adolphe sax‘s instruments (1867) in 1835 he perfected a bass clarinet superior to any that had preceded it. before long, sax concluded that belgium was too small for his ambitions. at the belgian exhibition (an industrial fair) in 1840 he presented nine inventions, among them an organ, a piano tuning process and a sound reflecting screen. the judges felt that sax was too young to receive the gold medal, and instead awarded him the vermeil (gilded silver). sax came to paris in 1842 and succeeded in interesting many eminent men, including composer hector berlioz. he set up a workshop in the rue st georges and studied acoustics, discovering a new principle in the manufacture of wind instruments, viz. that it is the proportions given to a column of air vibrating in a sonorous tube, and these alone, that determine the character of the timbre produced: the material of the walls of the tube is not of the slightest importance so long as it offers enough resistance.together with his genius for mechanical invention sax seems to have combined a knowledge of self advertisement, and his name was often prefixed to successful types of instrument for the invention of which he was not primarily responsible. sax also developed the saxotromba family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly. saxhorn instruments spread rapidly throughout the world. the saxhorn valves were accepted as state of the art and are largely unchanged today. on june 22, 1846 he registered the saxophone and won his gold medal at the paris industrial exposition in 1849. by the ned of the year sax had designed, on paper, a full range of saxophones (from sopranino to subcontrabass). although they never became standard orchestral instruments, the saxophones made his reputation and secured him a job, teaching at the paris conservatoire in 1857. “its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck” (hector berlioz about the saxophone) sax’s workshop sold some 20000 instruments between 1843 and 1860, but he was not a talented money manager, and sales were not enough to keep him solvent. he filed for bankruptcy three times, in 1852, 1873, and 1877, and he was saved from a fourth debacle only by the intervention of another of his admirers, emperor napoleon iii. he also effected various improvements in piston instruments, of which the most important was the substitution of a single ascending piston for a number of descending ones. sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery. in 1870 sax’s position at the paris conservatory was terminated in the aftermath of the franco prussian war, and he lived his final years in straitened circumstances, kept out of poverty only by a small pension arranged for him by an admirer. he died in 1894 in paris and was interred in the cimetière de montmartre. at yovisto, you can learn more about the saxophone in the lecture of dr. amy muchnick on woodwind instruments, entitled “the instrument families 2“.\\n',\n",

       " 'constantine and the battle at the milvian bridge.  battle of the milvian bridge by giulio romano, 1520-24.  on october 28, 312 ad, the battle of the milvian bridge between the roman emperors constantine i and maxentius took place. constantine won the battle and started on the path that led him to end the tetrarchy and become the sole ruler of the roman empire. according to historians, the battle marked the beginning of constantine’s conversion to christianity and thus fostered the rise of christianity. so, just another of those roman battles after diocletian stepped down on 1 may 305, his successors began to struggle for control of the roman empire almost immediately. although constantine was the son of the western emperor constantius, the tetrarchic ideology did not necessarily provide for hereditary succession. when constantius died on 25 july 306, his father’s troops proclaimed constantine as augustus in eboracum (york). in rome, the favorite was maxentius, the son of constantius‘ imperial colleague maximian, who seized the title of emperor shortly after on 28 october 306. but whereas constantine’s claim was recognized by galerius, ruler of the eastern provinces and the senior emperor in the empire, maxentius was treated as a usurper. galerius ordered his co augustus, severus, to put him down in early 307. once severus arrived in italy, however, his army defected to maxentius. severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed. galerius himself marched on rome in the autumn, but failed to take the city. constantine avoided conflict with both maxentius and the eastern emperors for most of this period. by 312, however, constantine and maxentius were engaged in open hostility with one another, although they were brothers in law. in the spring of 312, constantine gathered his forces and decided to oust maxentius himself. he easily overran northern italy, winning two major battles: the first near turin, the second at verona. it is commonly stated that on the evening of 27 october with the armies preparing for battle, constantine had a vision which led him to fight under the protection of the christian god. the details of that vision, however, differ between the sources reporting it. from eusebius, two accounts of the battle survive. the first, shorter one in the ecclesiastical history promotes the belief that god helped constantine but does not mention any vision. in his later life of constantine, eusebius gives a detailed account of a vision and stresses that he had heard the story from the emperor himself. according to this version, constantine with his army was marching, when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the greek words “[you shall] conquer when the two armies clashed at the milvian bridge in rome, constantine won a decisive victory. the dispositions of maxentius may have been faulty as his troops seem to have been arrayed with the river tiber too close to their rear, giving them little space to allow re grouping in the event of their formations being forced to give ground. the temporary bridge set up alongside the milvian bridge, over which many of the maxentian troops were escaping, collapsed, and those stranded on the north bank of the tiber were either taken prisoner or killed. maxentius was among the dead, having drowned in the river while trying to swim across it in a desperate bid to escape or, alternatively, he is described as having been thrown by his horse into the river. constantine’s victory gave him total control of the western roman empire paving the way for christianity to become the dominant religion for the roman empire and ultimately for europe. the following year, 313, constantine and licinius issued the edict of milan, which made christianity an officially recognised and tolerated religion in the roman empire. at yovisto you can learn more the roman empire under emperor constantine in the lecture series of prof diana kleiner on roman architecture about ‘rome of constantine and a new rome‘.\\n',\n",

(we live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air.)”, evangelista torricelli in a letter to michelangelo ricci, 11 june 1644 in 1644 the french scientist marin mersenne visited torricelli and took back to his friend blaise pascal the idea of the mercury barometer. if, pascal thought, air was indeed pressing downward upon us as torricelli contended, the total weight of the air, and hence its pressure, should decrease as altitude increases. with the help of his brother in law, pascal showed that barometric pressure did indeed decrease as one ascended a mountain. pascal’s observational evidence showed beyond any doubt that torricelli’s theory was correct. torricelli died in florence on 25 october 1647, a few days after having contracted typhoid fever, and was buried at the basilica of san lorenzo. the asteroid 7437 torricelli and a crater on the moon were named in his honor.   at yovisto, you can learn more about toricelli’s mercury barometer and the physics behind in the lecture of mit prof. donald sadoway on ‘solid state chemistry‘.\\n',\n",
       " 'pythagoras and his eponymous theorem.  bust of pythagoras, musei capitolini, roma. one of the founders of western mathematics was the greek philosopher pythagoras of samos. he is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic, and scientist and is best known for the pythagorean theorem which bears his name. it was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom. anyway, his eponymous theorem possibly is the best known theorem in mathematics. accurate facts about the life of pythagoras are so few that most information concerning him is untrustworthy, making it nearly impossible to provide more than a vague outline of his life. herodotus, isocrates, and other early writers all agree that pythagoras was born on samos, the greek island in the eastern aegean, as the son of mnesarchus, a gem engraver or a merchant from tyre, and his wife pythais. as to the date of his birth, aristoxenus stated that pythagoras left samos in the reign of polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 bc. little is known of pythagoras‘s childhood. certainly he was well educated, learning to play the lyre, learning poetry and to recite homer. there were, among his teachers, three philosophers who were to influence pythagoras while he was a young man. one of the most important was pherekydes who many describe as the teacher of pythagoras. the other two who shoud introduce him to mathematical ideas were thales and his pupil anaximander who both lived on miletus. it is said that pythagoras visited thales in miletus when he was between 18 and 20 years old, while thales already was an old man and. nevertheless he he created a strong impression on pythagoras and contributed to pythagoras’s interest in mathematics and astronomy. he advised him to travel to egypt to learn more of these subjects. thales’s pupil, anaximander, lectured on miletus and pythagoras attended these lectures. anaximander certainly was interested in geometry and cosmology and many of his ideas would influence pythagoras’s own views.. pythagoras left samos for egypt in about 535  to study with the priests in the temples. many of the practices of the society he created later in italy can be traced to the beliefs of egyptian priests, such as the codes of secrecy, striving for purity, and refusal to eat beans or to wear animal skins as clothing.  according to current research, it is not easy to say how much pythagoras learned from the egyptian priests, or indeed, whether he learned anything at all from them. according to porphyry, pythagoras was refused admission to all the temples except the one at diospolis where he was accepted into the priesthood after completing the rites necessary for admission. he took part in several discussions with the egyptian priests and possibly embraced the various customs of egyptian priests such as secrecy, not eating beans and wearing clothes that are not made from animal skins. during his time in egypt, he pursued his education and specialized in geometry and mathematics. in 525 bc cambyses ii, the king of persia, invaded egypt and pythagoras was taken prisoner and taken to babylon. it was about 520 bc when pythagoras returned to samos and after a short interlude went to southern italy in about 518 bc. there, pythagoras founded a philosophical and religious school in croton that had many followers. pythagoras was the head of the society with an inner circle of followers known as mathematikoi. the mathematikoi lived permanently with the society, had no personal possessions and were vegetarians. they were taught by pythagoras himself and obeyed strict rules. the outer circle of the society were known as the akousmatics and they lived in their own houses, only coming to the society during the day. they were allowed their own possessions and were not required to be vegetarians. since the fourth century ad (according to proclus, the last major greek philosopher), pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the pythagorean theorem, a theorem in geometry that states that in a right angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides. while the theorem that now bears his name was known and previously utilized by the babylonians and indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. for that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta mathematical problems. according to legend, the way pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations was when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and thought that the sounds emanating from their anvils were beautiful and harmonious and decided that whatever scientific law caused this to happen must be mathematical and could be applied to music. he went to the blacksmiths to learn how the sounds were produced by looking at their tools. he discovered that it was because the hammers were “simple ratios of each other, one was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on.” pythagoras went to delos in 513 bc to nurse his old teacher pherekydes who was dying. he remained there for a few months until the death of his friend and teacher and then returned to croton. in 510 bc croton attacked and defeated its neighbour sybaris and there is certainly some suggestions that pythagoras became involved in the dispute. then in around 508 bc the pythagorean society at croton was attacked by cylon, a noble from croton itself. pythagoras escaped to metapontium and the most authors say he died there, some claiming that he committed suicide because of the attack on his society. at yovisto, you you can learn more about the pythagorean theorem in the lecture of yale prof. n. j. wildenberger on ‘history of mathematics‘.\\n',\n",

       " 'heinrich olbers and the olbers’ paradox.  heinrich olbers (1758-1840). on october 11, 1758, german physician and astronomer heinrich wilhelm matthias olbers was born. besides his discovery of coments and minor planets, olbers is best known for his new method to calculate the velocity of falling stars. maybe you have also heard of the famous olbers’ paradox, which asks “why is the night sky dark if there are so many bright stars all around to light it?” heinrich olbers was born in arbergen, today part of bremen, germany, as eighth of the sixteen children of johann georg olbers, a protestant minister. in 1777, after finishing the gymnasium illustre in bremen, he went to the university of göttingen to study medicine to become a physician. but, already as a schoolboy, olbers developed an appreciation for astronomy. he was fascinated by the great comet of 1769 and also took additional lectures in physics, mathematics, and astronomy while studying medicine in göttingen. it was during those years that he developed an interest in comets, an interest he retained for the rest of his life. in 1779 olbers devised a new method of calculating the orbits of comets. in medical school olbers specialized in the emerging field of ophthalmology (the study of the function and treatment of eyes) and wrote his dissertation on how the eye shifts its focus. after his graduation in 1780, he began practicing medicine in bremen and quickly drew a large clientele. at night he dedicated his time to astronomical observation, making the upper story of his home into an observatory, where he pointed telescopes out of two large bay windows, and started with the collection of a private library of astronomical books. actually, his astronomy library had more than 4000 items, and it is now considered one of the most extensive private collections in all of europe. he took a leading role in the search for a planet between mars and jupiter. on march 28, 1802, olbers discovered and named the asteroid pallas, the second asteroid to be identified after giuseppe piazzi‘s discovery of ceres in 1801. actually, it was carl friedrich gauss, who sent olbers on the hunt for asteroids. gauss, who had attempted to calculate the orbit of the newly discovered ceres, asked olbers to look for ceres one year after its discovery, in the location gauss had predicted. olbers spotted ceres in the location predicted by gauss, thus proving the mathematician correct. the event that initiated a lifelong friendship between the two men. five years later, on march 29, 1807, he discovered the asteroid vesta, which he allowed gauss to name. as the word “asteroid” was not yet coined, the literature of the time referred to these minor planets as planets in their own right. because johann elert bode’s law, which gave the sequence of planetary distances in terms of a numerological formula, implied that there should be a planet between mars and jupiter, olbers proposed that asteroids are the broken up remnants of a medium sized planet that once orbited in the asteroid belt region. the current view of most scientists is that tidal effects from the planet jupiter disrupted the planet formation process in the asteroid belt. after that olbers returned to comet hunting. by the end of his life he had found four new comets and calculated the orbits of eighteen others. olbers also hypothesized, correctly, that matter ejected by a comet‘s nucleus is swept back into a tail by the force of the sun. on march 6, 1815, olbers also discovered a periodic comet, now named after him. after the death of his wife in 1820, olbers retired from his medical practice to become a full time astronomer. in 1823 he addressed a complex phenomenon that still bears his name, the “olbers’ paradox“, which asks “why is the sky dark at night?” if one assumes that the universe is infinite and contains an infinite number of unchanging stars, then it stands to reason that the sky should be lit up continuously by stars too numerous to count. the paradox, however, is that this description does not match with what we observe. olbers attempted an explanation for this, one which we now know is only partially correct. he theorized that interstellar space is not transparent, but contains dust which absorbs energy from the stars, preventing some of their light from reaching us on earth. but, there are more arguments to answer the question: the number of stars in the universe is not infinite. there simply are not enough stars in the sky to keep it lit up day and night. moreover, we now know that the universe is not unchanging, but that it is expanding and galaxies are moving apart. olbers was held in great esteem by his contemporaries. he was deputed by his fellow citizens to assist at the baptism of napoleon ii of france on june 9, 1811, because his hometown bremen was part of the french empire by that time (1811-1813). he was also a member of the corps legislatif in paris 1812–1813. in 1804 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of london, a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1822, and in 1827 a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences. in 1840, olbers died in bremen aged 81. he was twice married, and one son survived him. at yovisto you can learn more about astronomy in a popular lecture by neil

       " 'karl schwarzschild and the event horizon.  karl schwarzschild (1873 – 1916).  on october 9, 1873, german physicist and astronomer karl schwarzschild was born. he provided the first exact solution to the einstein field equations of general relativity, for the limited case of a single spherical non rotating mass, which he accomplished in 1915, the same year that albert einstein first introduced general relativity. the schwarzschild solution leads to a derivation of the schwarzschild radius, which is the size of the event horizon of a non rotating black hole. karl schwarzschild was born in frankfurt (main), germany and it is assumed that his family was well situated. it has been delivered that schwarzschild was a child prodigy, who published his first paper on celestial mechanics and constructed his own telescope before his 17th birthday. he began his career at the university of strasbourg in 1891 where he received a decent education in practical astronomy. in munich, schwarzschild earned his doctorate in 1896 with a thesis on henri poincaré’s theories.  schwarzschild was then appointed as an assistant at the von kuffner observatory in ottakring, a suburb of vienna, where he stayed until 1899. during his time in vienna, schwarzschild worked on ways to determine the apparent brightness of stars using photographic plates. while lecturing in munich as privatdozent, the scientist noticed a significant difference between the measured photographic magnitudes and the tabulated visual magnitudes. he concluded that the effect was due to the different colors of the stars and the range of magnitude change as measured by his photographic methods was greater than the range of change in visual magnitude. he further concluded that this effect is caused by the changes in surface temperature of the variable star through its cycle.  in the 1910s, schwarzschild was appointed professor at the prestigious university of göttingen, where he met and worked with important contemporary scientists including david hilbert and hermann minkowski. also, schwarzschild became director of the göttingen observatory. the scientist was appointed director of the astrophysical observatory in potsdam, the most prestigious post available for an astronomer in germany at that time and joined the german army with the outbreak of world war ii. still, he somehow managed to write several papers in 1915, two on relativity theory and one on quantum theory. schwarzschild is now credited with producing the first exact solutions to albert einstein’s field equations as well as the schwarzschild metric.  in schwarzschild’s solution, a radius for a given mass is identified, also known as the schwarzschild radius. if the mass could be compressed to fit within that radius, no known force or degeneracy pressure could stop it from continuing to collapse into a gravitational singularity or black hole. this means that where the radius of the body is less than its schwarzschild radius, everything falls inevitably into the central body. when the mass density of this central body exceeds a certain limit, it triggers a gravitational collapse to a schwarzschild black hole, known as a non charged, non rotating black hole. however, the possibility of black holes were in general not accepted until the second half of the 20th century, and schwarzschild himself did not believe in the physical reality of black holes, believing his theoretical solution to be physically meaningless.  at yovisto, you may be interested in a short video lecture on black holes.\\n',\n",
       " 'thales of miletus – (possibly) the father of greek mathematics.  illustration of (possibly) thales of miletus for today’s blog post, there is no birthday of a popular scientist. moreover, we want to tackle famous people in the history of science, who don’t have a known birthday. this of course holds for many philosophers, mathematicians, or natural scientists of antiquity or early middle ages. today, we want to start with the father of ancient greek mathematics, thales of miletus. according to bertrand russel, western philosophy (as well as mathematics) begins with thales of miletus. it is assumed that thales of miletus was born in the city of miletus, an ancient greek ionian city on the western coast of asia minor in today’s turkey. even though his exact time of life is unknown, historians later attempted to calculate it on the basis of events related to him in the later sources, most notably in the work “lives and opinions of eminent philosophers” by diogenes laertius. laertius wrote that thales of miletus may have died in the 58th olympiad at the age of 78. further, it is assumed that miletus’ family was financially good situated.  it is believed that miletus wrote ‘on the solstice‘ and ‘on the equinox‘, but none of these works survived and many doubt that miletus left any written book. still, in general there is only little doubt that miletus at the time had revolutionary approaches to philosophy and mathematics. this is mostly delivered by aristotle, who wrote in his ‘metaphysics‘ that miletus believed that everything comes out of water and that the earth floats on water. seneca also wrote that this ‘floating theory’ was used by miletus to explain earthquakes. revolutionary about this theory was the fact that miletus apparently rejected supernatural and mystical theories and that he was most likely the first to explain the world by unifying hypothesis.  thales of miletus is on this day also credited with several geometric theorems. one states that a circle is bisected by its diameter, he said that angles in a triangle opposite two sides of equal length are equal. also, miletus is credited with the theorems that opposite angles formed by intersecting straight lines are equal, that the angle inscribed inside a semicircle is a right angle, and that a triangle is determined if its base and the two angles at the base are given. still, it is not clear if miletus really is to be credited with these theorems, as many historians now argue. it is possible that miletus did not even have a way of measuring angles and most likely in that case, equal angles would have not been a concept he would have understood precisely.  at yovisto, you may be interested in a short video explanation on thales of miletus.\\n',\n",
       " 'richard leuckart and the tapeworm.  karl georg friedrich rudolf leuckart (1822-1898). on october 7, 1822, german zoologist karl georg friedrich rudolf leuckart was born. he is known to be one of the initiators of modern parasitology. leuckart described the complicated life histories of various parasites, including tapeworms and the liver fluke, and demonstrated that some human diseases, such as trichinosis, are caused by multicellular animals of the various wormlike phyla. rudolf leuckart was born in helmstedt, lower saxony as son of gottfried leuckart, print shop owner and councilman, and nephew of famous surgeon and natural scientist friedrich andreas sigismund leuckart (1794–1843). it was his uncle, who made a strong impression on leuckart and awakened his love for zoology. as a youth, he showed an early interest in zoology and in insects in particular. in 1842, he enrolled at the university of göttingen to study medical and natural sciences, where he studied under the renowned zoologist, rudolph wagner, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship and who encouraged him to research in this branch of science. in 1845 he finished his doctoral thesis (de monstris eorumque causis et ortu) with distinction and subsequently habilitated in 1847 as “privatdozent” (outside lecturer) in physiology and zoology with a study on the system on marine invertebrates. a result of this workd was the division of georges cuvier’s radiata into into two phyla: coelenterata and echinodermata (terms of his own devising). the result marked the beginning of a new period of scientific zoology, that of animal systematics based on subtle morphological investigations. the publication of this study as a result of his expedition to the north sea, soon raised his popularity among fellow scientists. in 1850 at age 28, he became a professor of zoology at the university of giessen, where justus von liebig and the anatomist and embryologist theodor bischoff were attracting many young researchers. leuckart is remembered for his work in parasitology, particularly research regarding tapeworm and trichinosis. he was especially interested in the sexual organs of the lower animals and in parthenogenesis, as well as in polymorphism, a term he originated. he was the first to prove that taenia saginata occurs only in cattle (and humans), and taenia solium occurs only in swine (and humans). his study of trichina helped support rudolf virchow‘s campaign to create meat inspection laws in germany. with virchow and friedrich albert von zenker, he was the first to document the life cycle of the parasite trichinella spiralis in swine and humans. he also did important studies of the sheep liver fluke. coelenterata (hydromedusae, acalephae) from leuckart’s wall charts  in 1869 leuckart accepted an offer from the university of leipzig. the facilities at his disposal were at first inadequate, but in 1880 he was given a new zoological institute constructed according to his plans and furnished with laboratories, a museum, and a library. zoologists from all over the world came to the institute as guest researchers. leuckart’s outstanding skill as a teacher and his clear delivery brought him many students who later held chairs of zoology all over the world. in the field of entomology, he conducted investigations into the micropyle and fertilization of insect eggs, the reproduction and development involving members of pupipara, parthenogenesis among insects, and studies on the anatomy and life history of the honeybee. between 1877 and 1892, he developed a series of zoological wall charts that have been used worldwide as teaching aids. the fruit of leuckart’s research in parasitology, the two volume die menschlichen parasiten und die von ihnen herrührenden krankheiten, was never completed; the aging leuckart did not find the strength to finish it. nevertheless, it has become a classic of parasitology. today the “rudolf leuckart medaille” is an annual award for research in parasitology by the deutschen gesellschaft für parasitologie (german society of parasitology). “it is not possible for man, as a thinking being, to close his mind to the knowledge that he is ruled by the same power as is the animal world. like the despised worm he lives in dependence upon external commands, and like the worn he perishes, even when he has shaken the world through the power of his ideas.” (richard leuckart) at yovisto, you can learn more about biology in the lecture of mit prof. eric lander in his first lecture on ‘introduction into biology‘ from 2004.\\n',\n",
       " 'richard dedekind and the real numbers.  richard dedekind (1831 – 1916)  .  on october 6, 1831, german mathematician julius wilhelm richard dedekind was born. he is known for making important contributions to abstract algebra (particularly ring theory), algebraic number theory and the foundations of the real numbers. richard dedekind was the son of an administrator at collegium carolinum in braunschweig. his family was known as pretty influential and the young richard enrolled in 1848 at the collegium in order to study mathematics as well. two years later, he continued his studies in göttingen and was taught by the famous carl friedrich gauß who motivated him to write his dissertation in 1852 ‘on the theory of eulerian integralsi‘. however, dedekind preferred to continue his studies at the university of berlin, which was known to have the best reputation in the field of mathematics. there, he was awarded the habilitation and returned to göttingen shortly after, where he was appointed privatdozent of geometry and probability. it is assumed that dedekind was the first to teach galois’ theory and to understand the notion of groups in algebra and arithmetic. after a short period of teaching in zurich, switzerland, dedekind returned to his native braunschweig where he spent the rest of his working career, because the collegium carolinum was upgraded to an institute of technology.  one of dedekind’s best known contributions to mathematics is the ‘dedekind cut‘. the idea behind a cut is that an irrational number divides the rational numbers into two classes, with all the members of one class being strictly greater than all the members of the other class. his thought on irrational numbers and dedekind cuts was published in his pamphlet “continuity and irrational numbers”, in modern terminology better known as completeness. in the later 1870s, dedekind began his first works fundamental to ring theory, even though the term ‘ring‘ never appeared in his writings. dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients. the concept underwent further development in the hands of hilbert and, especially, of emmy noether.  dedekind was elected to the academies of berlin and rome, and to the french academy of sciences. he received honorary doctorates from the universities of oslo, zurich, and braunschweig.   at yovisto, you may be interested in a lecture on gauss’ law.\\n',\n",
       " 'robert goddard – the man who ushered in the space age.  robert h. goddard (1882-1945). on october 5, 1882, american professor, physicist, and inventor robert hutchins goddard was born. he is credited with creating and building the world’s first liquid fueled rocket, which he successfully launched on march 16, 1926. goddard’s work as both theorist and engineer anticipated many of the developments that were to make spaceflight possible. he has been called the man who ushered in the space age. moreover, i’m pretty sure that you have heart of the goddard space flight center, a major nasa space science laboratory located in greenbelt, maryland. there is also a crater on the moon named after goddard as well as the blue origin goddard, a private spacecraft which first flew in november 2006. robert h. goddard was born in worcester, massachusetts to nahum danford goddard, a businessman, and fannie hoyt goddard. early in life, young robert suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis which kept him out of school for long periods of time. however, he kept up with his studies and was an avid readers. it was after reading  wells’s “the war of the worlds” that he first became interested in space exploration. he experimented with chemicals and created a cloud of smoke and an explosion in the house. goddard’s father further encouraged robert’s scientific interest by providing him with a telescope, a microscope, and a subscription to scientific american. after graduating from school, robert goddard applied and was accepted at worcester polytechnic institute. in 1907, while a student at worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts, goddard experimented on a rocket powered by gunpowder in the basement of the physics building. clouds of smoke caused a lot of commotion and the faculty, rather than expel him, took an interest in his work. goddard received his  degree in physics from worcester polytechnic in 1908, and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at clark university in worcester in the fall of 1909. goddard received his  degree in physics from clark university in 1910, and then stayed at clark to complete his ph.d. in physics in 1911. he spent another year at clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912, he accepted a research fellowship at princeton university’s palmer physical laboratory. unfortunately, in early 1913, goddard became seriously ill with tuberculosis, and had to leave his position at princeton. he then returned to worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery. in 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. the first described a multi stage rocket fueled with a solid “explosive material.” the second described a rocket fueled with a solid fuel (explosive material) or with liquid propellants (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). the two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry. overall, he published 214 patents, some posthumously by his wife. goddard’s thoughts on space flight started to emerge in 1915, when he theorized that a rocket would work in a vacuum, and didn’t need to push against air in order to fly. this meant that in the vacuum of space, rocket engines would be able to produce thrust. at his own expense, he began to make systematic studies about propulsion provided by various types of gunpowder. he began experiments on the efficiency of rockets. he bought some commercial rockets and measured their thrust using a ballistic pendulum, a heavy mass suspended by ropes, to which the rocket was attached. the rocket was fired, and the height to which the pendulum rose provided a measure of the total momentum (mass times velocity) imparted to it. goddard also used an equivalent set up, where the mass pushed against a spring, instead of being suspended. goddard turned his attention to the components of his rockets. a swedish engineer, gustav de laval, had designed a turbine for a steam engine that implemented a new kind of nozzle to blow jets of steam onto the wheel. the nozzle first narrowed, then expanded, allowing the steam to reach the speed of sound and creating an efficient conversion of heat to motion. by replacing his existing nozzle with the de laval nozzle, goddard’s rockets were able to increase their efficiency to up to 63 percent. in 1917, goddard received a $5000 grant from the smithsonian institution in washington, , to support his development of a rocket to probe the upper atmosphere. clark university also contributed financially, and goddard had permission to use their lab and the lab at worcester polytechnic institute for experimentation. powder rockets were still problematic. goddard returned to an idea he first developed in 1914 for a liquid fueled rocket. hermann oberth in germany and konstantin tsiolkovsky in russia had both reached the same conclusion. working independently — with no apparent knowledge of one another’s research — they made similar developments in the field of rocket science. all three are considered to be the fathers of modern rocketry. goddard’s rocket relied on a combination of gasoline and liquid oxygen. two lines ran into the combustion chamber. to overcome the high temperatures required for the combustion of pure oxygen, goddard designed the extremely cold liquid oxygen to cool the combustion chamber as it traveled from the fuel tank, a method still used today. indeed, the flight of goddard’s rocket on march 16, 1926, at auburn, mass., was as significant to history as that of the wright brothers at kitty hawk. primitive in their day as the achievement of the wrights, goddard’s rockets made little impression on government officials. only through modest subsidies from the smithsonian institution and the daniel guggenheim foundation, as well as the leaves of absence granted him by the worcester polytechnic institute of clark university, was goddard able to sustain his lifetime of devoted research and testing. goddard moved to roswell, new mexico, in the 1930s, where he continued to work on his rockets over the course of his lifetime. the open desolation provided the perfect place to work on his rockets in safety, and he launched 31 rockets over 15 years. goddard was able to flight test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. but goddard never lived to see his dream of a rocket traveling into space. he died of throat cancer at his home in baltimore on aug. 10, 1945, twelve years before the launch of the russian satellite, sputnik. at yovisto, you can learn more about the future of the us space program in the ted

       " 'james lind and a cure for scurvy.  james lind (1714-1794). on october 4, 1714, scottish physician james lind was born. he was a pioneer of naval hygiene in the royal navy. by conducting the first ever clinical trial, he developed the theory that citrus fruits cured scurvy. his work advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved nutrition. james lind was born in edinburgh, scotland, to margaret (smelum) and james lind, a prosperous merchant whose wife had medical connections. he attended grammar school in his youth, and then was apprenticed to the edinburgh physician george langlands,a fellow of the incorporation of surgeons which preceded the royal college of surgeons of edinburgh, in 1731. he became a surgeon’s mate in the british navy in 1739, serving in the mediterranean, off the coast of west africa and in the west indies. by 1747 he had become surgeon of hms salisbury in the channel fleet, and conducted his experiment on scurvy while that ship was patrolling the bay of biscay. it was a well known fact that far more sailors on british warships died from scurvy than from battle. in 1740 the catastrophic result of anson’s circumnavigation attracted much attention in europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 had died, most of them allegedly from having contracted scurvy. vitamin c is necessary for the maintenance of healthy connective tissue. if sailors did not get vitamin c in their food, especially from fruits like oranges, lemons, or limes, then they developed the symptoms of scurvy: bleeding gums, loosened teeth, stiff or swollen joints, and bleeding under the skin. infections often resulted, and if infections did not kill the sailors, then they soon died from convulsions or coma if they were left untreated. on long voyages, entire crews could be decimated by scurvy.  before lind’s work, eversince antiquity in various parts of the world others had noticed that citrus fruits were good for health. the spanish physician, michael servetus, said in 1537 that citrus fruits were good for digestion. admiral sir richard hawkins of the british navy noticed in 1593 that feeding his men citrus fruit each day seem to eliminate scurvy. also john woodall (1570–1643), an english military surgeon of the british east india company recommended them but their use did not become widespread. although lind was not the first to suggest citrus fruit as a cure for scurvy, he was the first to study their effect by a systematic experiment in 1747. lind set out in 1747 to prove experimentally that citrus fruits cured scurvy. lind thought that scurvy was due to putrefaction of the body which could be helped by acids, and thus included a dietary supplement of an acidic quality in the experiment. while he was aboard the . salisbury from august to october 1747, he created an experiment in which he tested the effectiveness of dietary supplements on scurvy patients. he started after two months at sea when the ship was afflicted with scurvy. he divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. they all received the same diet but, in addition, group one was given a quart of cider daily, group two twenty five drops of elixir of vitriol (sulfuric acid), group three six spoonfuls of vinegar, group four half a pint of seawater, group five received two oranges and one lemon, and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of barley water. the treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. apart from that, only group one also showed some effect of its treatment. just after that patrol he left the navy, wrote his md thesis on venereal diseases and earned his md from the university of edinburgh medical school, and was granted a license to practice in edinburgh, scotland. in may 1750 he was elected a fellow of the royal college of physicians of edinburgh. in 1753 he published a treatise of the scurvy, which was virtually ignored. in 1758 he was appointed chief physician of the royal naval hospital haslar at gosport. when james cook went on his first voyage he carried wort (the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisky), sauerkraut and a syrup, or “rob”, of oranges and lemons as antiscorbutics, but only the results of the trials on wort were published. in 1762 lind’s essay on the most effectual means of preserving the health of seamen appeared. in it he recommended growing salad on wet blankets. this was actually put in practice, and in the winter of 1775 the british army in north america was supplied with mustard and cress seeds. however lind, like most of the medical profession, believed that scurvy had multiple causes, but essentially was a result of ill digested and putrefying food within the body, bad water, excessive work and living in a damp atmosphere which prevented healthful perspiration. although he recognized the benefits of citrus fruit, he never advocated citrus juice as a single solution, but recommended multiple remedies. james lind retired as chief physician at haslar in 1783, and his son john, who had been his assistant, succeeded him in the post. lind died in gosport in 1794. at yovisto, you can learn more about scurvy in the great presentation of meg rosenbaum entitled ‘arrr, scurvy knaves!‘ published and animated via phd comics.\\n',\n",

       " 'the unfortunate inventions of charles cros.  charles cros (1842-1888). on october 1, 1842, french poet and inventor charles cros was born. he developed various improved methods of photography including an early color photo process. he also invented improvements in telegraph and paleophone technology. but lacking financial resources, he was unable to patent his devices before thomas edison and others developed the idea and started production. émile hortensius charles cros was born in fabrezan, aude, france, 35km to the east of carcassonne. in 1860, he began studies in medicine, but he soon abandoned them for a life of literary and scientific pursuits. it is referenced that he had designed an automatic telegraph and displayed it at the world fair of 1867. but, he is much better known for having “almost” invented color photography and sound recording. in 1869 cros published a theory of color photography in which he proposed that a single scene could be photographed through glass filters colored red, yellow, and blue. the three negatives obtained through those filters could be developed to produce positive impressions that contained varying amounts of the filter’s antichromatic colors green, violet, and orange. the three positive impressions, when superimposed on one another would recompose the original colors of the photographed scene. cros’s proposals, which anticipated the subtractive method of modern photography, were similar to more influential ideas advanced about the same time by louis ducos du hauron. the same day, may 7, 1869, charles cros and louis ducos du hauron presented their method of creating colour photographs to the french society of photography. they had not been in communication beforehand and each knew nothing about the other’s research. cros ended up conceding the invention to ducos du hauron, despite having sent his paper to the french academy of sciences on december 2, 1867. ducos du hauron had patented the idea on november 28, 1868, almost a full year later. in 1869 he published an opuscule entitled “a study of the means of communicating with other planets.” it was published as a little brochure and the author sent copies to the academy of sciences and the newspapers. cros was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on mars and venus, probably high clouds illuminated by the sun, were the lights of large cities on those planets. he spent years petitioning the french government to build a giant mirror that could be used to communicate with the martians and venusians by burning giant lines on the deserts of those planets. he was never convinced that the martians were not a proven fact, nor that the mirror he wanted was technically impossible to build. however, cros is perhaps most famous as the man who almost, but not quite, invented the phonograph. no one before charles cros had thought of reproducing sound by making an apparatus capable of registering and reproducing sounds which had been engraved with a diaphragm. he named his invention the paleophone (voix du passé). on april 30, 1877, three months before thomas edison’s invention of the phonograph, cros submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the academy of sciences in paris explaining his proposed method. the letter stated, “a lightweight index is fixed to the center of figure of a vibrating membrane, it ends with a tip […] based on a blackened surface flame. this surface is integral with a disc driven by a double movement of rotation and linear progression. the system is reversible: when the tip makes ironing in the furrow membrane restores the original acoustic signal.“ in his letter, after having shown that his method consisted of detecting an oscillation of a membrane and using the tracing to reproduce the oscillation with respect to its duration and intensity, cros added that a cylindrical form for the receiving apparatus seemed to him to be the most practical, as it allowed for the graphic inscription of the vibrations by means of a very fine threaded screw. however, the abbé lenoir, a clergyman–science writer, described the cros process in an article published in “la semaine du clergé” on october 10, 1877, giving the name phonographe. before cros had a chance to follow up on this idea or attempt to construct a working model, edison introduced his first working phonograph in the us, who used a cylinder covered in tinfoil for his first phonograph, patenting this method for reproducing sound on january 15, 1878. edison and cros apparently did not know of each other’s work in advance. as a literary figure, cros frequented the salons of parisian symbolists and décadents. with those devotees of the avant garde, he aspired to create a type of poetry that, through lyrical, rhythmic language and striking imagery, would succeed in evoking the sensations and emotions of the artist. befriended with verlaine and rimbaud he was known to frequent many of the popular parisian cafés at the time and in 1873 charles cros wrote one of the most beautiful poems relating to absinthe of all times, “lendemain”, part of his book of poems, “le coffret de santal”. with flowers, and with women, with absinthe, and with this fire, we can divert ourselves a while, act out our part in some drama. absinthe, on a winter evening, lights up in green the sooty soul; and

       " 'étienne de condillac and the importance of language in logical reasoning.  étienne bonnot de condillac (1714-1780).  on september 30, 1714, french philosopher and epistemologist étienne bonnot de condillac was born. a leading advocate in france of the ideas of john locke de condillac further emphasized the importance of language in logical reasoning, stressing the need for a scientifically designed language and for mathematical calculation as its basis. étienne de condillac was born at grenoble as the youngest of three brothers to gabriel bonnot, vicomte de mably, and catherine de la coste. “condillac” was the name of an estate purchased by his father in 1720. he is said to have had very poor eyesight and a weak physical constitution, factors that so retarded his intellectual development that as late as his twelfth year he was still unable to read. his education began only in his teens, first under the direction of a local priest, then at lyons, later as seminarian in paris, at saint suplice and at the sorbonne. he took holy orders in 1740 at saint sulpice church in paris and was appointed as abbot of mureauand, but did no pastoral work.  condillac published two main philosophical works: the essay on the origin of human knowledge of 1746, and the treatise on sensations of 1754, both of which were devoted to expositing his views on the role of experience in the development of our cognitive capacities. in his works la logique (1780) and la langue des calculs (1798), condillac emphasized the importance of language in logical reasoning, stressing the need for a scientifically designed language and for mathematical calculation as its basis. as a philosopher, condillac gave systematic expression to the views of john locke, previously made fashionable in france by voltaire. in retrospect, condillac’s importance is both in virtue of his work as a psychologist, and his systematic establishment of locke’s ideas in france. like locke, condillac maintained an empirical sensationalism based on the principle that observations made by sense perception are the foundation for human knowledge. in the traité des sensations, condillac questioned locke’s doctrine that the senses provide intuitive knowledge. he doubted, for example, that the human eye makes naturally correct judgments about the shapes, sizes, positions, and distances of objects. examining the knowledge gained by each sense separately, he concluded that all human knowledge is transformed sensation, to the exclusion of any other principle, such as locke’s additional principle of reflection. according to condillac, all sensation is affective, that is, causes pain or pleasure. sensations, consequently, are the source of all active faculties. need, for example, is the result of the privation of some object whose presence is demanded either by nature of habit. need, subsequently, directs all energy towards this missing object. this directionality, condillac claimed, is what we call desire. will is absolute desire, made vigilant by hope. in paris condillac spent some years spent living the life of a man of letters in paris and was involved with the circle of denis diderot, the philosopher who was co contributor to the encyclopédie. he developed a friendship with jean jacques rousseau, which lasted in some measure to the end of his life. together with his brother gabriel, who became the well known political writer known as abbé de mably, condillac introduced rousseau to an intellectual circle. condillac’s relations with unorthodox philosophers did not injure his career. he had already published several works when the french court sent him to parma to educate the orphan duke prince ferdinand of parma, then a child of seven years. in 1768, on his return from italy, condillac was elected to the académie française. contrary to the popular idea that he attended only one meeting, he was a frequent attendee until two years before his death. near the end of his life, condillac turned his attention to politics and economics. his economic views, which were presented in le commerce et le gouvernement, were based on the notion that value depends not on labour but rather on utility. the need for something useful, he argued, gives rise to value, while prices result from the exchange of valued items. finding the irreligious climate of parisian intellectual society offensive, he retired to spend his last years at flux, near beaugency on the loire river. he died there on 3 august 1780. at yovisto, you can learn more about condillac’s age of enlightenment in the talk of gresham college prof. justin champion on ‘why the enlightenment still matters today‘.\\n',\n",

[…] they decided to go down to the shore to see whether they could escape by sea, but the waves were still running too high. there my uncle lay down on a sail that had been spread for him, and called twice for some cold water, which he drank. then a rush of flame, with the reek of sulfur, made everyone scatter, and made him get up. he stood with the help of his servants, but at once fell down dead, suffocated, as i suppose, by some potent, noxious vapor. he had always had a weak respiratory tract, which was often inflamed and obstructed. at yovisto, diana e. e. kleiner explores the civic, commercial, and religious buildings of pompeii as part of her lecture on ‘roman architecture‘. she is an art historian known worldwide for her expertise on the art and architecture of the ancient romans.\\n',\n",
       " 'paul nipkow and the picture scanning technology.  paul nipkow (1860-1940). on august 22, 1860, german engineer paul gottlieb nipkow was born. he is best known for having conceived the idea of using a spiral perforated disk (the nipkow disk), to divide a picture into a matrix of points, and became an early television pioneer. nipkow was born on august 22, 1860, in lauenburg (lębork) in pomerania, now in poland. inspired by the work of guglielmo marconi, nipkow began thinking about the challenge of transmitting a visual image while still a student in germany. while at school in neustadt (wejherowo), west prussia, nipkow began to experiment in telephony and the transmission of moving pictures. it was well known that any successful transmission device required three essential components: a device to translate the visual image into an electronic impulse, a second device to reassemble that impulse into an image again, and a third device by which to transmit the impulse from the first device to the second. in 1884, even before completing his degree, nipkow had developed and patented a transmissions system that achieved all three requirements. while still a student nipkow conceived the idea of using a spiral perforated disk (nipkow disk), to divide a picture into a matrix of points. accounts of its invention state that the idea came to him while sitting alone at home with an oil lamp on christmas eve, 1883. alexander bain, a scottish inventor who had patented the electric clock, had transmitted images telegraphically in the 1840s but the nipkow disk improved the encoding process. the nipkow disk was a metal or cardboard disk that was perforated with twenty square holes arranged in a spiral so that each hole was a little closer to the center than the last. as nipkow spun the disk, he shined a strong light through the holes and onto the subject. because each hole was slightly offset, the image was scanned in a series of twenty horizontal lines. nipkow‘s disk from his 1884 patent application another important component of his invention was a selenium photocell used to transform differences in the intensity of light into electric current. the current could be transmitted to a receiver, where the image was reproduced with an identical disk that was synchronized with the first in front of a lamp whose brightness changed according to the received signal. nipkow once used his device to transmit a visual image from london to paris, but the system was never developed for commercial use. ironically, at the time, investors could not foresee a practical use for it, and therefore, nipkow received little recognition during his lifetime for the feat. nipkow applied for a patent in the imperial patent office in berlin for his electric telescope. this was for the electric reproduction of illuminating objects, in the category “electric apparatuses”. german patent no. 30105 was granted on 15th january 1885, retroactive to 6th january 1884, the 30 marks fee being lent by his future wife. it was allowed to lapse after 15 years. nipkow had taken a position as a designer in the berlin buchloh institute and did not continue further development of the electric telescope. the first television broadcasts used an optical mechanical picture scanning method, the method that nipkow had helped create with his disk. the first inventor who used nipkow’s disc successfully, creating the first television pictures in his laboratory in october 1925, was john logie baird. from 1937, when the infant bbc television service chose it above baird’s mechanical system, total electronic picture scanning, based on the work of manfred von ardenne and the iconoscope invented by vladimir zworykin, became increasingly prevalent and nipkow’s invention was no longer essential to further development of television. today, the nipkow disk is used extensively in reflected light confocal scanning microscopy to produce images that can be viewed in real time through the microscope eyepieces. at yovisto you can watch an rca documentary on the history of television to learn more about the invention of television and its early days.\\n',\n",

       " 'nicolas jacques conté and the pencil.  nicolas jacques conté (1755-1805). on august 4, 1755, french painter, inventor, army officer and balloonist, nicolas jacques conté was born. among others, he is credited with the invention of the modern pencil. moreover, some consider him one of the greatest inventive minds of the eighteenth century. he distinguished himself for his mechanical genius which was of great avail to the french army in egypt. napoleon bonaparte called him “a universal man with taste, understanding and genius capable of creating the arts of france in the middle of the arabian desert.” nicolas jacques conté was born at saint céneri près sées (now aunou sur orne) in normandy, france, as one of six children. he was the descendent of a family of farmers who had cultivated the same fields for over two hundred years. of his family we know little except that one of his brothers took over the responsibilities of the estate after the death of his father, while the other left the household to establish his own farm. two of his sisters became nuns at the hotel dieu de sées. it is related that, at the age of nine, conté fashioned a violin with a knife as his sole tool. if the story is true, it records the earliest indication of his later accomplishments. one of his distinctive traits was the ability to imagine, design, and fabricate beyond the normal limitations of the equipment available to him. he was given a job as assistant to the gardener at the hotel dieu de sées, where he was also given the task of aiding a painter who was commissioned to decorate the chapel of the convent with a series of panels. he worked at grinding pigment and cleaning brushes and began to learn about painting by observation. when the painter fell ill, conté asked if he might try his hand. he argued that he should be allowed to do one panel which, if considered unsuccessful, could be painted over. needless to say, the trial was acceptable and he completed the decoration of the chapel. the beginning of his career as an artist was assured. one of his early interest while still at sées was in the newly developing science of aeronautics. he made at least one hot air balloon which he flew in the public square. he contributed to the improvement of the production of hydrogen gas, as well as the treatment of the gas bag of the balloon itself. he also took up portrait painting, from which he derived a considerable income. passionately interested in mechanical arts and science, he began displaying his inventive faculty during the french revolution. in 1794, as director of the aerostatic (montgolfiers) school he taught chemistry, physics and mechanics. he lost the left eye in an explosion experimenting with gases and varnish. later he invented a telegraphic system for long distance communication in balloons. prior to conté’s time pencils had almost all been made from lumps of pure graphite, mined from the borrowdale mine in england and sawed into strips that were then encased in wood. in 1794 all this changed when conté, already a famous inventor and scientist was charged by his patron, carnot, to invent a substitute for the now expensive and difficult to come by pure english graphite. the french republic was at that time under economic blockade and unable to import graphite from great britain, the main source of the material. it took him just 8 days to produce a workable lead. in just over a week he had invented what was to become known as the conté process: a way to make pencil leads from powdered graphite and clay that us still, essentially, used today. previous attempts to use graphite in powdered form (perhaps from material extracted from low quality ore in poorer mines, or in an attempt to use the waste products generated by sawing and cutting) had always foundered but conté worked out how to mix graphite in powdered form with clay, and bake it, in such a way that not only did he produce a usable lead, but was able to make leads in varying degrees of hardness. as well as his process for mixing leads, conté is also generally credited with inventing the machinery needed to make round leads, and he can truly be said to be the creator of the pencil. indeed, for about 100 years, pencils in france were known as the crayons conté and of course pencils continue to be made with the conté brand name to this day . after improving the barometer he parted with the scientific expedition to egypt organized by napoleon bonaparte. there, nicolas jacques started his participation in the conquest of egypt by inventing a tan method to avoid the fast rusting of metals provoqued by the egyptian weather. he studied the physics of mirages and the arts and production methods of the egyptian people. during the cairo’s rebellion most of the instruments of the arts and sciences commission were lost. conté said “we have no instruments; it is simple, we are going to reconstruct them“. he played an important role in developing many different procedures including fabrication of cardboard, coins, powder, windmills, chirurgical instruments, telescopes, cannon carriages for the desert, ovens and many other instruments. moreover, he also participated in the reproduction of the rossette stone by chalcography. the reproduction that was the basis for champollion’s work on egyptian hieroglyphes. no wonder that napoleon said about him “conté was able to recreate the french arts in the middle of arabian deserts“. in 1801, coming back to france, conté directed the elaboration of “description de l’égypte“, a wonderful work about egypt. he invented an engraving machine for the illustrations of the description. on december 5, 1805, he died from an aneurism at the age of 50. learn more about the creativity of innovators and inventors in the ted talk of elizabeth gilbert on ‘a different way to think about creative genius‘.\\n',\n",

       " 'john tyndall and the physics of air.  john tyndall (1820-1893). caricatured as a preacher in the magazine vanity fair, 1872.  on august 2, 1820, british physicist john tyndall was born. his initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his study of diamagnetism. later he made discoveries in the realms of infrared radiation and the physical properties of air. as the most prominent example, he was able to demonstrate why the sky is blue. john tyndall was born in leighlinbridge, county carlow, ireland, where his father was a local police constable. he attended the local schools in county carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher near the end of his time there. subjects learned at school notably included technical drawing and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to land surveying. in 1839, he was hired as a draftsman by the government’s land surveying mapping agency in ireland and england. in the decade of the 1840s, a railroad building boom was in progress, and tyndall’s land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies, who employed tyndall in railway construction planning. in 1847 he began to teach mathematics at queenwood college hampshire. in 1848 tyndall went to study in germany where he was one of the first british subjects to receive the new ph.d. at marburg. his years in germany while still a young man turned tyndall into something of a naturphilosophisch romantic pantheist . he stayed at marburg for a further year doing research on magnetism. in summer 1951, tyndall returned to england, where he first continued his experimental work on magnetism and diamagnetic polarity, which soon made tyndall known among the leading scientists of the day. he was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1852. in 1853, he attained the prestigious appointment of professor of natural philosophy (physics) at the royal institution in london, due in no small part to the esteem his work had garnered from michael faraday, the leader of magnetic investigations at the royal institution, whose successor be became at the royal institution after faraday’s retirement. in 1859 tyndall began to study the capacities of various gases to absorb or transmit radiant heat. he showed that the main atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are almost transparent to radiant heat, whereas water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone are such good absorbers that, even in small quantities, these gases absorb heat radiation much more strongly than the rest of the atmosphere. tyndall concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling surface air temperature by inhibiting leakage of the earth’s heat back into outer space. he declared that, without water vapour, the earth’s surface would be ‘held fast in the iron grip of frost’ – the greenhouse effect. in 1869 tyndall discovered the scattering of light by dust and large molecules, now known as the tyndall effect. he noticed that a beam of light, visible as it passed through ordinary laboratory air, disappeared when it entered a flask of pure filtered water. he now passed a light beam through filtered air and got the same result – no beam. he deduced that light bounces off little particles and into our eyes, allowing us to see the beam. he found that different sized particles scattered light in different ways. tyndall suggested that the sky is blue because molecules in the atmosphere preferentially scatter the sun’s blue rays.  john tyndall combined his glacier researches with mountaineering, at which he became expert. in 1860 he made the first ascent of the weisshorn, and he climbed mount blanc, the highest alpine peak, several times. he narrowly missed being the first person to summit the matterhorn (he was third), and made numerous other difficult climbs throughout the alps. mountaineering gained the status of a sport partly because of his popular narratives, including his glaciers of the alps (1860) and hours of exercise in the alps (1871) . tyndall made many other contributions to science. for example he invented the fireman’s respirator and his invention of the light pipe led to the development of fibre optics. tyndall married louisa hamilton at the age of 56. insomnia plagued tyndall, and this, combined with general ill health, led to his resignation from the ri in 1887. as his insomnia got worse he experimented with a variety of drugs. he died in 1893 from an accidental overdose of chloral administered by louisa. learn more about gasses in the yovisto lecture of prof. sylvia ceyer from mit’s open course ware on ‘kinetic theory – behavior of gases‘. >\\n',\n",

       " 'karl popper and the philosophy of science.  karl raimund popper (1902-1994). on july 28, 1902, austrian british philosopher sir karl raimund popper was born. he is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of science of the 20th century. popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments. karl raimund popper was born in vienna to simon siegmund carl popper, a lawyer from bohemia and jenny schiff popper, who was of silesian and hungarian descent. all of karl popper’s grandparents were jewish, but the popper family converted to lutheranism before karl was born. they understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. karl’s father was a bibliophile who had 12000–14000 volumes in his personal library. by the time, vienna claimed to be the cultural epicentre of the western world. karl attended the local realgymnasium, where he was unhappy with the standards of the teaching, and, after an illness which kept him at home for a number of months, he left to attend the university of vienna in 1918. however, he did not formally enrol at the university by taking the matriculation examination for another four years. in 1919 he became heavily involved in left wing politics, joined the association of socialist school students, and became for a time a marxist. however, he was quickly disillusioned with the doctrinaire character of the latter, and soon abandoned it entirely. he also discovered the psychoanalytic theories of siegmund freud and alfred adler, and listened entranced to a lecture which albert einstein gave in vienna on relativity theory. the dominance of the critical spirit in einstein, and its total absence in marx, freud and adler, struck popper as being of fundamental importance: the pioneers of psychoanalysis, he came to think, couched their theories in terms which made them amenable only to confirmation, while einstein’s theory, crucially, had testable implications which, if false, would have falsified the theory itself . popper had a rather melancholic personality and took some time to settle on a career; he obtained a primary school teaching diploma in 1925, took a ph.d. in philosophy in 1928 and qualified to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school in 1929. the dominant philosophical group in vienna at the time was the wiener kreis, a circle of ‘scientifically minded’ intellectuals including rudolf carnap, otto neurath, viktor kraft, and hans hahn with the principal objective to unify the sciences. for his part, popper became increasingly critical of the main tenets of logical positivism. he articulated his own view of science, and his criticisms of the positivists in “logik der forschung” in 1934 (translated by popper himself twenty five years later under the title the logic of scientific discovery), which gained him an enormous reputation and had a tremendous impact on the scientific community. “in point of fact, no conclusive disproof of a theory can ever be produced; for it is always possible to say that the experimental results are not reliable or that the discrepancies which are asserted to exist between the experimental results and the theory are only apparent and that they will disappear with the advance of our understanding. if you insist on strict proof (or strict disproof) in the empirical sciences, you will never benefit from experience, and never learn from it how wrong you are.” (karl popper) due to the rise of fascism in austria as well as in germany and the steady growth of anti semitism, popper was forced to leave austria. in 1937, he went to new zealand and taught philosophy as a senior lecturer at the university of canterbury. after the second world war, he went to london, first as reader in logic and scientific method, then in 1949 became a professor of logic and scientific method at the london school of economics, a post which he held until 1969. many visits as a guest professor in the united states followed, amongst them the william james lectures at harvard in 1950. popper’s relations with many of his most devoted students were now often stormy and, with the exception of one or two cases, tended to end in open hostility. popper had become intolerant of dissent and also inclined to misunderstand the nature of his own contribution to the philosophy of science. he believed that he had solved the problem of how scientific knowledge is generated and established. in reality he had merely moved the problem one step forward and so opened an entirely new problem. in demonstrating that all scientific knowledge is only provisional and hypothetical, he had invited doubts as to the degree to which it genuinely corresponded to reality. these doubts were pursued by thomas kuhn and led him to a relativism which never gained popper’s approval. he had public debates with ernst bloch and theodor adorno, two of the most popular luminaries of continental philosophy in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1972 he published his third major book, objective knowledge, in which he established a close link between his philosophy of science and the development of neo darwinism. he was knighted in 1965. popper continued to think and write until the very last years of his life. he died on 17 september 1994 in croydon, surrey. at yovisto, you can listen to an excerpt of sir karl popper’s ‘science as falsification‘ from his 1963 book ‘conjectures and refutation’.\\n',\n",

       " 'the plays of george bernard shaw.  george bernard shaw (1856-1950). on july 26, 1856, irish playwright and co founder of the london school of economics george bernard shaw was born. as a writer, his main talent was for drama, and he wrote more than 60 plays. he is the only person to have been awarded both a nobel prize in literature (1925) and an oscar (1938). george bernard shaw was born in synge street, dublin, to george carr shaw, an unsuccessful grain merchant and sometime civil servant, and lucinda elizabeth shaw, a professional singer. his education was irregular, due to his dislike of any organized training. when shaw was just short of his sixteenth birthday, his mother left her husband and son and moved with vandeleur lee to london, where the two set up a household, along with shaw’s older sister lucy. after working in an estate agent’s office for a while he moved to london as a young man (1876), where he established himself as a leading music and theatre critic in the eighties and nineties and became a prominent member of the fabian society, for which he composed many pamphlets . together with beatrice and sidney webb, shaw had founded the fabian society, a socialist political organization dedicated to transforming britain into a socialist state, not by revolution but by systematic progressive legislation, bolstered by persuasion and mass education. the fabian society would later be instrumental in founding the london school of economics and the labour party. in 1891, at the invitation of  grein, a merchant, theatre critic, and director of a progressive private new play society, the independent theatre, shaw wrote his first play, widower’s houses. shaw’s first plays were published in volumes titled “plays unpleasant” (containing widowers’ houses, the philanderer and mrs. warren’s profession) and “plays pleasant” (which had arms and the man, candida, the man of destiny and you never can tell). the plays were filled with what would become shaw’s signature wit, accompanied by healthy doses of social criticism, which stemmed from his fabian society leanings. these plays would not go on to be his best remembered, or those for which he had high regard, but they laid the groundwork for the oversized career to come . in 1897 shaw attained his first commercial success with the american premiere of the devil’s disciple, which enabled him to quit his job as a drama critic and to make his living solely as a playwright. in 1898, after a serious illness, shaw resigned as theatre critic, and moved out of his mother’s house (where he was still living) to marry charlotte payne townsend, an irish woman of independent means. although shaw was occasionally linked with other women, this marriage lasted until charlotte’s death in 1943 . the norwegian playwright henrik ibsen had a great influence on shaw’s thinking. for a summer meeting of the fabian society in 1890, he wrote the quintessence of ibsenism (1891), in which he considered ibsen a pioneer, “who declares that it is right to do something hitherto regarded as infamous.” pygmalion, by bernard shaw, by far his most popular work, was first performed in 1913. “although shaw claimed that he had written a didactic play about phonetics, and its anti heroic protagonist, henry higgins, is indeed a speech professional, what playgoers saw was a high comedy about love and class, about a cockney flower girl from covent garden educated to pass as a lady, and the repercussions of the experiment… the first world war began as pygmalion was nearing its hundredth sell out performance, and gave shaw an excuse to wind down the production.“, according to one of the leading experts on shaw, stanley weintraub . during world war i, shaw’s anti war pamphlets and speeches made him very unpopular as a public figure. in heartbreak house (performed 1920) he exposed the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the carnage. next came back to methuselah (1922) and saint joan (1923), acclaim for which led to his receiving the nobel prize for literature for 1925. shaw continued to write plays and essays until his death in 1950 at the age of 94. at yovisto you can learn more about george bernard shaw in the educational encyclopedia britannica production ‘shaw vs. shakespeare i: the character of caesar‘\\n',\n",

       " 'friedrich bessel and the distances of stars.  friedrich wilhelm bessel (1784-1846). .  on july 22, 1784, german mathematician and astronomer friedrich wilhelm bessel was born. he is probably best known for his works in mathematics, where he discovered the eponymous bessel functions, which are critical for the solution of certain differential equations. friedrich wilhelm bessel was born in minden, westphalia (today germany), as second son of a civil servant. bessel attended the gymnasium in minden for four years but he did not appear to be very talented, finding latin difficult, although he later succeeded in teaching the ancient language to himself. at the age of 14 bessel was apprenticed to the import export concern kulenkamp at bremen. at first bessel received no salary from the firm. the business’s reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his mathematical skills to problems in navigation. this in turn led to an interest in astronomy as a way of determining longitude. in 1804 bessel wrote a paper on halley’s comet, calculating the orbit using data from observations made by thomas harriot and william lower in 1607 . this brought him to the attention of a major figure of german astronomy at the time, heinrich wilhelm olbers, the leading comet expert of his time. olbers recognised at once the quality of bessel’s work and olbers gave bessel the task of making further observations to carry his work further. the resulting paper, at the level required for a doctoral dissertation, was published on olbers’ recommendation. from that time on bessel concentrated on astronomy, celestial mechanics and mathematics. in 1806 bessel accepted the post of assistant at the lilienthal observatory, which gave him valuable experience observing planets, in particular saturn, its rings and satellites. he also observed comets and continued his study of celestial mechanics. in january 1810, at the age of 26, bessel was appointed director of the new founded königsberg observatory by king frederick william iii of prussia. there he published tables of atmospheric refraction derived from james bradley’s observations of the positions of 3222 stars made around 1750 at greenwich (bradley was english astronomer royal from 1742 to 1762), which he had already began in 1807. while the observatory was still in construction bessel elaborated the fundamenta astronomiae based on bradley’s observations. it was not possible for bessel to receive a professorship without first being granted the title of doctor. a doctorate was awarded by the university of göttingen on the recommendation of gauss, who had met bessel in bremen in 1807 and recognized his talents. since 1819 bessel determined the position of over 50000 stars assisted by some of his qualified students. with this work under his belt, bessel was able to achieve the feat for which he is best remembered today: he is credited with being the first to use parallax in calculating the distance to a star. bessel showed in 1838 that 61 cygni, a star barely conceivable with the naked eye, apparently moved in an ellipse every year. this back and forth motion, called the annual parallax, could only be interpreted as being caused by the motion of earth around the sun. astronomers had believed for some time that parallax would provide the first accurate measurement of interstellar distances—in fact, in the 1830s there was a fierce competition between astronomers to be the first to measure a stellar parallax accurately. in 1838 bessel publicly announced that 61 cygni had a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds; which, given the diameter of the earth’s orbit, indicated that the star is 10.3 lightyears away (by today’s measurement of 11.4 lightyears, bessel’s estimation did only deviate by ca. 10%). another major discovery by bessel was that the two bright stars sirius and procyon execute minute motions that could be explained only by assuming that they had invisible companions disturbing their motions. the existence of such bodies, now named sirius b and procyon b, was confirmed with more powerful telescopes after bessel’s death . besides these activities, he was ordered to undertake a geodetical survey of east prussia (“ostpreussische gradmessungen”). from the differences between geodetical and astronomical coordinates, bessel derived the figure of earth as an oblated spheroid with ellipticity 1/299.15 (bessel normal ellipsoid). bessel also contributed significantly to mathematics and invented the so called bessel functions (also called cylindrical functions) in 1824. bessel died in königsberg on march 17, 1846 at age 62 from a long mysterious disease which we now know was probably intestine cancer. at yovisto you can learn more about astronomy in a popular lecture by neil degrasse tyson at the university of washington in seattle.\\n',\n",
       " 'jean picard and his love for accuracy.  jean félix picard (1620 – 1682).  on july 21, 1620, french astronomer, cartographer and hydraulic engineer jean félix picard was born. he is regarded as the founder of modern astronomy in france. he introduced new methods, improved the old instruments, and added new devices, such as huygens‘ pendulum clock to record times and time intervals. jean félix picard was born as a son of a bookseller and was allowed to study at the jesuit collège royal henry le grand, which was considered one of the best educational centers in france. it is assumed that he left the institution without a degree and moved to paris due to the unstable situation in france. in paris, he met the well established astronomer and mathematician pierre gassendi. he motivated picard to study astronomy and picard was allowed to assist with observations of solar and lunar eclipses. picard became a professor of astronomy, as it is assumed, in 1655. he continued his career at the college de france in paris, but unfortunately, there is no published work by picard known from this period. however, it is known that he exchanged letters with christian huygens, ole rømer, and giovanni cassini and it is assumed that he was highly respected as a scientist at that time. also, he became one of the first members of the academie royal des sciences one year after its founding in 1666. between 1669 and 1670, picard was the first person to measure the size of the earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy, building on maurolycus’ methodology and snellius’ mathematical discoveries. picard was honored with a pyramid at juvisy sur orge for his significant scientific effort. he was able to achieve this by measuring one degree of latitude along the paris meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from paris to the clock tower of sourdon, near amiens. his measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. the polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. this was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. this was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. the quadrant he used to determine the size of the earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter minutes. the sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. these equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to tycho brahe’s four minutes of error. this made his measurements 24 times as accurate. it is believed that isaac newton used this value in his theory of universal gravitation. picard’s method and measurements were the topic of his mesure de la terre, published in 1671. he was also an important member of the team that began to compile a map of france based on scientific principles and he became a major figure in the development of scientific cartography. in 1673 he was at the paris observatory collaborating with cassini, rømer, and la hire on the institute’s regular project of observations. picard directed his attention to other projects of the académie such as the surveying operations at marly and versailles. for example he became active in the problem of supplying versailles with water. he also performed barometric experiments and became generally more and more active in the field of physics. picard published scientific papers on hydraulics and optics. he made several suggestions to improve the telescope and left behind manuscripts on dioptrics. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video on the cnes mission, named after the french scientist jean félix picard. cnes’s picard microsatellite is designed to simultaneously measure parameters such as the sun’s speed of rotation, radiated power, sunspots, figure and diameter, in order to better understand its inner workings.\\n',\n",
       " 'sir john reith and the bbc.  on july 20, 1889, john charles walsham reith, 1st baron reith, was born. sir john reith was the first general director of the british broadcasting corporation and regarded as one of bbcs founding fathers. his concept of broadcasting as a way of educating the masses marked for a long time the bbc and similar organizations around the world. john reith was the founder of the bbc. he was its first general manager when it was set up as the british broadcasting company in 1922; and he was its first director general when it became a public corporation in 1927. he created both the templates for public service broadcasting in britain; and for the arms length public corporations that were to follow, especially after world war two. reith fought off the politicians’ attempts to influence the bbc, while offering the british people programmes to educate, inform and entertain. john charles walsham reith was born on july 20th 1889 at stonehaven, kincardineshire, uk, as the youngest, by ten years, of seven children. his family were holidaying there from glasgow, where his father george was a minister in the free church of scotland. reith was educated at the glasgow academy then at gresham’s school, holt, norfolk. his father refused to support any further education and apprenticed him as an engineer at the north british locomotive company. serving in world war i, reith was struck in the cheek by a bullet in october 1915, at which time he was a lieutenant, and transferred to the royal engineers, where he resigned his territorial army commission in 1921 in the rank of a captain. reith had no broadcasting experience when he replied to an advertisement in the morning post for a general manager for an as yet unformed british broadcasting company in 1922. he later admitted that he felt he possessed the credentials necessary to manage any company. in his new role, he was “confronted with problems of which i had no experience: copyright and performing rights; marconi patents; associations of concert artists, authors, playwrights, composers, music publishers, theatre managers, wireless manufacturers.“. slowly but surely, reith began to advance into the unknown medium of public radio transmission, organising, experimenting and innovating. realising the almost unlimited possibilities of broadcasting, and that it must eventually become a public service, he began to shape his organisation in that direction. the two of the main objects of reith’s policy were to establish the independence of the bbc from any form of interference and to build an unassailable programme. in 1925 the government appointed a committee under the chairmanship of lord crawford to consider the future of british broadcasting, where reith prepared a plan for a public broadcasting service. according to his plans, news presentations would always be of the highest quality, and sunday observance was strictly enforced. when the general strike broke out in 1926, and the value of broadcasting as a governmental and political instrument became apparent, winston churchill and others in the government wanted to commandeer the organisation for the emergency. reith refused to comply, maintaining the bbc’s independence. he won the argument, but made an enemy of churchill for years to come. actually, the bbc was part share owned by a committee of members of the wireless industry. although opposed by some (including in government), the bbc became a corporation in 1927 and reith was knighted the same year. reith’s autocratic approach became the stuff of bbc legend. his preferred approach was one of benevolent dictator, but with built in checks to his power. in 1938, with his work for broadcasting completed and his ideals established as traditions, he resigned to become managing director of imperial airways. but, two years later, when britain was at war, he left this post to become minister of information under prime minister neville chamberlain. when churchill succeeded chamberlain in may 1940, old animosities prevailed and he was quickly transferred, first to the ministry of transport and then to the ministry of works and buildings. he was also elevated to the house of lords, becoming baron reith of stonehaven. after the war, his sense of purpose was revived in his chairmanships of the commonwealth telecommunications board, from 1946 to 1950, and the colonial development corporation, 1950 to 1959. when the bbc introduced the reith lectures in 1947 it was honouring the corporation’s debt to the man whose far sightedness and clarity of purpose in early british broadcasting had demanded technical inventiveness and social conscience in equal proportions. at the age of 81, john reith died in edinburgh after a fall in 1971. this is a british pathé newsreel of ms. sir john reith, minister of information speaking at the cinematography exhibitors association in 1940.\\n',\n",

and the increasing disturbances of the revolution made her privileges as ambassadress very important safeguards. she fled the september massacres in 1792, and then moved to coppet castle, where she gathered round her a considerable number of friends and fellow refugees, the beginning of the salon which at intervals during the next 25 years made the place so famous. it was during these years that madame de staël was of chief political importance. and it was also the time that she became regarded by contemporary europe as the personal enemy of napoleon bonaparte. it displeased napoleon that madame de staël should show herself recalcitrant to his influence. but it probably pleased madame de staël to quite an equal degree that napoleon should apparently put forth his power to crush her and fail. both personages had a curious touch of theatricality. “madame,” the general informed the lady in question, “i do not want women mixed up in politics.” “you are perfectly right,” came the reply, “but in a country where their heads are cut off, it is only natural for them to want to know why.” (exchange between napoleon bonaparte and madame de staël.) she formed the nucleus of a liberal resistance that so embarrassed napoleon that in 1803 he had her banished to a distance of 64km from paris. from december 1803 to april 1804 she made a journey through germany, culminating in a visit to weimar, already established as the shrine of johann wolfgang von goethe and friedrich von schiller. in berlin she met august wilhelm von schlegel, who was to become, after 1804, her frequent companion and counselor. meanwhile madame de staël, persecuted by the police, fled from napoleon’s europe. having married a young swiss officer, “john” rocca in 1811, she went to austria and, after visiting russia, finland, and sweden, arrived in england in 1813. she was received with enthusiasm, although reproached by such liberals as lord byron for being more anti napoleonic than liberal. on the bourbon restoration in 1814, madame de staël returned to paris but was deeply disillusioned: the fall of napoleon had been followed by foreign occupation and had in no way reestablished liberty in france. during the hundred days she escaped to coppet and in september 1815 set out again for italy. in 1816 she returned to spend the summer at coppet, where she was joined by lord byron, in flight from england after his unhappy matrimonial experience. a strong friendship developed between the two writers. madame de staël lived only two years following napoleon’s defeat. by coincidence, de staël died in paris on july 14, 1817 – bastille day – the day commemorating one of the first events of the french revolution. at yovisto you can learn more about goethe and his philosophical conception of the world in prof fred amrine’s lecture ‘kicking away the ladder‘\\n',\n",

       " 'samuel goudsmit and the electron spin.  george uhlenbeck, hendrik kramers, and samuel goudsmit in 1928.  on july 11, 1902, dutch born  physicist samuel abraham goudsmit was born. he is best known for the formulation of the concept of electron spin together with george eugene uhlenbeck. it led to recognition that spin was a property of protons, neutrons, and most elementary particles and to a fundamental change in the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. if you not happen to be a physicist, you probably will never have heard that electrons have a spin. well, electrons are not literally spinning balls of charge, but they do have intrinsic angular momentum. spin angular momentum is real angular momentum. the angular momentum of a spin 1/2 particle like an electron is never zero. but, let’s go back one more step. in 1891, the irish physicist, george stoney, believed that electricity should have a fundamental unit. he called this unit the electron and the electron as the first sub atomic particle was discovered by  thomson in 1897. besides its electric charge and mass, an electron has one more key property, which is called “electron spin“. two types of experimental evidence which arose in the 1920s suggested this additional property of the electron. one was the closely spaced splitting of the hydrogen spectral lines, called fine structure. the other was the stern gerlach experiment which showed in 1922 that a beam of silver atoms directed through an inhomogeneous magnetic field would be forced into two beams. both of these experimental situations were consistent with the possession of an intrinsic angular momentum and a magnetic moment by individual electrons. classically this could occur if the electron were a spinning ball of charge, and this property was called electron spin. samuel goudsmit was born in the hague, netherlands, as son of jewish parents isaac and marianne goudsmit. as he was proud to claim throughout his life, his father was a small manufacturer of water closets fixtures while his mother ran a millinery shop. samuel goudsmit started his professional life at the university of leyden during the earliest days of quantum mechanics as a student of paul ehrenfest, a theoretical physicist, who made major contributions to the field of statistical mechanics and its relations with quantum mechanics. ehrenfest was both, an outstanding scientist as well as a gifted pedagogue. under ehrenfest’s tutelage goudsmit published his first scientific paper already at age 19 in 1921 in the prestigious journal “die naturwissenschaften“. in 1925 goudsmit together with his fellow graduate student george uhlenbeck were assigned by ehrenfest to work for a quick update on “what was currently happening in physics”. thus, while being a graduate student, goudsmit and uhlenbeck discovered the spin on the electron. in 1927 after receiving their phd, goudsmit and uhlenbeck together moved to the united states where they continued their physics careers until death. from 1927 to 1946, goudsmit served as a professor at the university of michigan. he was also the scientific head of the alsos mission and successfully reached the german group of nuclear physicists around werner heisenberg and otto hahn at hechingen (then french zone) in advance of the french physicist yves rocard. as part of the manhattan project, alsos was designed to assess the progress of the nazi atomic bomb project. goudsmit published in 1947 his conclusion that the germans did not get close to creating a weapon, which he attributed to the inability of science to function under a totalitarian state. his other conclusion, that the german scientists simply did not understand how to make an atomic bomb, has been disputed by later historians. after the war he was briefly a professor at northwestern university and from 1948-1970 was a senior scientist at the brookhaven national laboratory. in 1974, goudsmit moved to the faculty of the university of nevada in reno, where he remained until his death four years later. at yovisto, you may learn more about particle physics in the inside tour of the world` biggest supercollider lch at the cern research institute, given by physicist brian cox.\\n',\n",
       " 'camille pissaro and the impressionistic art movement.  camille pissarro (1830-1903). on july 10, 1830, danish french impressionist and neo impressionist painter camille pissaro was born. his importance resides in his contributions to both impressionism and post impressionism. he acted as a father figure not only to the impressionists but to all four of the major post impressionists, including georges seurat, paul cézanne, vincent van gogh and paul gauguin. jacob abraham camille pissarro was born on the island of st. thomas in the danish west indies (since 1917 the us virgin islands) to frederick and rachel pissarro, a merchant of portuguese jewish descent. at age twelve camille’s father sent him to boarding school in france. he studied at the savary academy in passy near paris. while a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the french art masters. however, when he returned to st. thomas at age 17, his father preferred that he worked in his business and gave him a job working as a cargo clerk. he took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practice drawing during breaks and after work. pissarro was attracted to political anarchy, an attraction that may have originated during his years in st. thomas. in 1852, he traveled to venezuela with the danish artist fritz melbye, who inspired pissarro to take on painting as a full time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. in 1855, pissarro left for paris, where he began working as assistant to anton melbye, fritz melbye’s brother, and studied at various academic institutions under a succession of masters, such as jean baptiste camille corot, gustave courbet, and charles francois daubigny. the harvest, 1882, bridgestone museum of art, tokyo in 1859 pissarro’s first painting was accepted and exhibited. his other paintings during that period were influenced by his tutor camille corot. he and corot both shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature. it was by corot that pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors, also called “plein air” painting. camille left his home in louveciennes to move to england during the franco prussian war and the commune (1870-71) and, with claude monet, he painted a series of landscapes around norwood and crystal palace as well as studying english landscape painters in the museums. on returning home to louveciennes at the end of the war a year later, camille discovered that only 40 of his 1500 paintings – almost twenty years’ work – remained undamaged. in the summer of 1871 camille settled in pontoise where he was to remain for the next ten years, gathering a close circle of friends around him. paul cézanne repeatedly came to stay with him and under camille’s influence learned to study nature more patiently. in the early 1870s pissarro devoted a great deal of thought to the idea of creating an alternative to the salon, a plan he discussed with monet, renoir, and others. they devised the idea of a society with a charter based on that of a local bakers’ union, and by january 1874 pissarro helped found a cooperative along these lines. in april of that year the group held their first exhibition at the studio of the photographer félix nadar in paris, at 35 boulevard des capucines, a show that became known as the first impressionist exhibition, which shocked and “horrified” the critics, who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious, historical, or mythological settings. in 1871, pissarro married julie vellay, a maid in his mother’s household. of their eight children, one died at birth and one daughter died aged nine. the surviving children all painted, and lucien, the oldest son, became a follower of william morris. the boulevard montmartre on a winter morning, 1897, metropolitan museum of art by the 1880s, pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting to break out of what he felt was an artistic “mire”. as a result, pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people. this period also marked the end of the impressionist period due to pissarro’s leaving the movement. it was pissarro’s intention during this period to help “educate the public” by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings, without idealising their lives. in 1885 he met georges seurat and paul signac, both of whom relied on a more “scientific” theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colors to create the illusion of blended colors and shading when viewed from a distance. adapting this neo impressionistic or pointilistic style, pissarro’s sales dipped as well as his rate of production. the family suffered considerably. pissarro eventually turned away from neo impressionism, claiming its system was too artificial. but, once he threw off the shackles of this labor intensive direction, his natural verve reignited and his production soared. so did his prices and by the end of 1890s, the family enjoyed a comfortable income. in his older age pissarro suffered from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. as a result of this disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. he often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. pissarro died in paris on 13 november 1903 and was buried in père lachaise cemetery. at yovisto you can learn more about impressionism in the lecture of dr. parme giuntini, director of art history at otis college of art and design, on impressionism.\\n',\n",

       " 'albert von kölliker and the origins of embriology.  rudolf von kölliker (1817-1902). on july 6, 1817, swiss anatomist and physiologist albert von kölliker was born. he was one of the founders of embryology. his thorough microscopic work on tissues enabled him to be among the first to identify their structure. he showed that they were made up of cells, that did not freely come into being, but must develop from existing cells. rudolph albert kölliker was born in zurich, switzerland. his early education was carried on in zurich, and he entered the university there in 1836. after two years, however, he moved to the university of bonn, and later to that of berlin, becoming a pupil of noted physiologists johannes peter müller and of friedrich gustav jakob henle. he graduated in philosophy at zurich in 1841, and in medicine at heidelberg in 1842. the first academic post which he held was that of prosector of anatomy under henle, but his tenure of this office was brief. in 1844 he returned to zurich university to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of physiology and comparative anatomy. in 1847 the university of würzburg, attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. he accepted the appointment, and at würzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the bavarian town, where he died on the 2nd of november 1905. kölliker made substantial contributions to the study of zoology. while his earlier efforts were directed to the invertebrates, he soon passed on to the vertebrates, and studied the amphibians and mammalian embryos. he was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer microscopic technique the methods of hardening, sectioning and staining. by doing so, not only was he enabled to make rapid progress himself, but he also placed in the hands of others the means of a similar advancement. the remarkable strides forward which embryology made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century will always be associated with his name. his lectures on development, published in 1861, at once became a standard work. but neither zoology nor embryology furnished kölliker’s chief claim to fame. he is best known for his contributions to histology, the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal tissues. among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that smooth or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. in this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master henle. a few years before this, there was doubt whether arteries had muscle in their walls. in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the nervous system on the circulation, which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology. kölliker and his fellow scientists were better able to undertake histological research than before because the microscope in germany had been improved during the 1820s to such an extent that the obstacles which seventeenth century microscopists had encountered in their investigations had been overcome. the amateur scientist antoni van leeuwenhoek had observed nerve cells, but the microscopes which he used produced distorted images. the cells which he wanted to study did not stand out from the surrounding fluids or the background. in 1864 kölliker revived étienne geoffroy saint hilaire’s theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of heterogenesis. he was a critic of darwinism and rejected a universal common ancestor, instead he supported a theory of common descent along separate lines. in honor of his scientific achievements, kölliker received the title of nobility “von kölliker” and became a fellow of the royal society in 1860, which honored him in 1897 with their highest token of esteem, the copley medal. at yovisto, you may enjoy a video lecture on human embryology by professor steven fink.\\n',\n",

(andrew ellicott) douglass was born. he coined the name dendrochronology for tree ring dating, a field he originated while working at the lowell observatory, flagstaff, arizona, by his discovery a correlation between tree rings and the sunspot cycle. a. e. douglass was not the first, who suggested that a tree’s rings could determine its age. the first known record of the idea come from leonardo da vinci. however, douglass was the first to use cross dating methods successfully to determine a tree’s age. a. e. douglass was born in vermont in 1867 and later on enrolled at trinity college in connecticut. he continued his career at the observatory at harvard university, which opened a completely new observatory in peru. there, douglass mainly observed planet mars, which not only fascinated the american astronomer, but also the businessman, author, and astronomer percival lowell. together, they established a new observatory in flagstaff, arizona. through the years, douglass came to realize, that there might be a connection between sunspots and the weather on earth. also gregor johann mendel got this idea in this period. in 1904, douglass observed the rings of several trees. he noticed that the structure of wider and smaller rings is equal in trees of the same kind and the same region. douglass found out that in regions of higher precipitation, the rings were wider than in drier regions. douglass also realized that historical buildings made of wood may give information on the weather conditions from over hundreds of years ago and dendrochronology was born. the astronomer established the laboratory of tree ring research at the university of arizona in 1937, where until this day visiting scholars and faculty at the lab have done notable work in the areas of climate change, fire history, ecology, archeology and hydrology. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture by the professor of dendrochronology at the university of arizona titled “global climate change: the evidence“.\\n',\n",

why not stamp the letters and immediately cast them in metal in the same machine? by 1884 the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called matrices, and casting molten metal into them, all within a single machine, was applied. mergenthaler reportedly got the idea for the brass matrices that would serve as molds for the letters from wooden molds used to make “springerle,” which are german christmas cookies. as a boy he had carved a springerle mold for his stepmother. ottmar mergenthaler demonstrates the linotype, drawing by j. coggleshall wilson, 1886 the first typesetting machine that was used commercially, known as “the blower,” was demonstrated in the new york tribune’s composing room in 1886. according to mergenthaler’s son herman, “when tribune publisher whitelaw reid … saw ottmar type on the keyboard and shortly after a thin metal slug bearing several words slid down into a tray, he exclaimed, ‘ottmar, you’ve done it! a line o’ type!’ thus the linotype machine was born.“. in the printing office of the new york tribune the machine was immediately used on the daily paper and a large book. as a result of his cost-, labor-, and time saving machine and the attention it got via the tribune, mergenthaler’s business increased: he enlarged his camden street shop and expanded to an additional building on preston street to handle the flood of orders. initially, the mergenthaler linotype company was the only company producing linecasting machines, but around 1914 a linecasting machine would be produced by the competition — the intertype company. by 1904, there were 10000 linotypes in use, but by 1954 the number had skyrocketed to 100000. during the 1970s and 1980s, linotype and similar “hot metal” typesetting machines were retired and replaced with phototypesetting equipment and later computerized typesetting and page composition systems. in 1894, mergenthaler contracted tuberculosis. two years later, unable to stand the cold, he moved to the southwest, first to prescott, arizona, and then to deming, new mexico. he returned to baltimore in late 1897 after a fire destroyed his new mexico house and the manuscript of his just completed autobiography. he died of tuberculosis in baltimore in 1899 at age only 45. like gutenberg, mergenthaler revolutionized the art of printing. “the eighth wonder of the world” is what thomas a. edison called mergenthalers seminal invention. at yovisto, you can learn more about the history of printing and the linotype technology in an educational video from the 1960s.\\n',\n",

       " 'ignaz semmelweis and the importance of washing your hands as a doctor.  ignaz semmelweis (1818 – 1865).  on july 1, 1818, hungarian physician of german extraction ignaz semmelweis was born. he is best known for his discovery of the cause of puerperal (“child bed”) fever and introduced antisepsis into medical practice by insisting on health workers rigorously handwashing between patients, and clean bed sheets. at first, ignaz semmelweis studied law at the university of vienna, but switched to medicine shortly after, specializing in obstetrics. at the first obstetrical clinic of the vienna general hospital, where semmelweis was employed, he had to examine patients each morning in preparation for the professor’s rounds, supervise difficult deliveries, and teach students of obstetrics. back in the day, maternity clinics became quite common. women could receive free medical care after giving birth, but had to function as subjects for the training of doctors and midwives. in vienna, there were approximately two of those institutions while semmelweis was still a young doctor. he began examining, why in one of the clinics the mortality rate due to puerperal fever was significantly higher than in the other. semmelweis examined all the differences in techniques and even considered religious practices. he noticed that the clinic with the higher mortality rate offered a teaching service for students, the other instructed midwives only. the scientist also noticed that his friend, jakob kolletschka, died after getting cut during surgery and that his wound looked very similar to what he saw in his patients. eventually, semmelweis found out that the medical students carried “cadaverous particles” on their bodies and especially their hands after performing autopsies in the clinic. he concluded that these particles may cause childbed fever and introduced a policy of using a solution of chlorinated lime for washing hands before and after examining their patients. all students or doctors who enter the wards for the purpose of making an examination must wash their hands thoroughly in a solution of chlorinated lime which will be placed in convenient basins near the entrance of the wards. this disinfection is considered sufficient for this visit. between examinations the hands must be washed in soap and water. this method became known as the “semmelweis doctrine” and it was successful. within a few months, the mortality rate due to puerperal fever shrank from 10% to 1.34%. however, not all of his colleagues enjoyed the new rules and semmelweis even moved one step further. he proposed that the students performing dissections should not examine the living patients in the hospital beds in order to prevent the diease rather than ‘removing’ it. unfortunately, the head of his department did not support the idea and refused to continue semmelweis‘ contract at the hospital. in a huff, semmelweis departed for budapest immediately, where he was appointed head of the obstetrical service at the st. rochus hospital in pest and managed achieve a mortality rate of 0.85% on a maternity service where puerperal fever had previously raged. in 1861, semmelweis published his findings titled as “the etiology, concept, and prophylaxis of puerperal fever” even though they were already announced to the profession in 1847 by his friend ferdinand von hebra, who was the editor of the journal of the royal imperial society of physicians in vienna. many scientists began supporting semmelweis’ doctrine and a lot of doctors, particularly in germany, appeared quite willing to experiment with the practical hand washing measures that he proposed, but virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground breaking theoretical innovation, that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. soon semmelweis’ doctrine was forgotten and ignored in the field of obstetrics, which disturbed semmelweis incredibly while the mortality from puerperal fever on the services of some of these opposing professors of midwifery ranged as high as a barbarous 26% (for example in würzburg). semmelweis‘ eccentric behavior did definitely not make it any better. to a professor in würzburg he wrote: your teaching (that the würzburg epidemic of childbed fever is caused by unknown atmospheric influences or puerperal miasma is false), and is based on the dead bodies of lying in women slaughtered through ignorance. . . i have formed the unshakable resolution to put an end to this murderous work as far as lies in my power so to do. . . (if you continue teaching your students this false doctrine), i denounce you before god and the world as a murderer, and the history of puerperal fever will not do you an injustice when, for the service of having been the first to oppose my life saving lehre, it perpetuates your name as a medical nero. in 1865, ignaz semmelweis died from an infected wound on his finger, received during a gynecological operation. he suffered from an extensive sepsis leading to his early death. by a tragic irony, semmelweis died from the same disease as his friend, kolletschka, whose death provided the clue to the prevention of puerperal fever. posthumously, semmelweis’ doctrine gained acceptance widely. louis pasteur’s work offered a theoretical explanation for semmelweis‘s observations, the germ theory of disease. the “semmelweis reflex” is on this day seen as a metaphor for a certain type of human behavior characterized by reflex like rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, beliefs or paradigms. at yovisto, you may enjoy a video lecture on the germ theory of disease by yale professor frank snowden.\\n',\n",
       " 'adolf furtwängler and photographic archeology.  adolf furtwängler (1853 – 1907).  on june 30, 1853, german archaeologist and historian adolf furtwängler was born. he revolutionized archeological science with his use of photography for documentation. his use of photography in research supplanted the use of drawings because a camera gives objective reproduction with more accuracy, which enabled fragments to be scrutinized, even when they were miles apart. adolf furtwängler grew up in a very educated family. his father was a classical scholar and schoolmaster. and also adolf furtwängler studied at the university of leipzig and published his dissertation on “eros in der vasenmalerei”. in the following years, he worked in italy and greece, financially supported by the german archeological institute and was able to join heinrich schliemann’s excavations at olympia. he completed his habilitation in 1878 under reinhard kekulé in bonn. in 1879 he published together with his colleague georg loeschcke, “mykenische thongefäße”, a complete publication of the mycennean pottery finds on aegina, which was not only a valuable chronology but the first corpus of pottery finds in archaeology. this groundbreaking study established the difference between mycenaean and geometric pottery and contributed to the developing technique of identifying archaeological strata. as his reputation grew, furtwängler received several job offers and was appointed assistant director at the royal museums of berlin and as a privatdozent at the university of berlin. in 1885, furtwängler’s two volume “beschreibung der vasensammlung im antiquarium” (writings on vase paining in antiquity) appeared, a book describing over four thousand objects in a manner still emulated today. in the following years, furtwängler published numerous brilliant works, he issued a study on greek gems and their inscriptions, renewed the excavations at the temple of aphaia in aigina, and began issuing a corpus of greek vases along with karl w. reichhold. furtwängler also embarked on writing a history of ancient art, but contracted a case of dysentery in aigina and died at age 54, cutting short a brilliant career. his students formed the most eminent of the next generation of classical art historians and archaeologists including ludwig curtius, oskar waldhauer, georg lippold, and eduard schmidt. in his active working years, photography was already widely established, but it was not used very often in scientific documentations. most archeologists still relied on detailed drawings, however, a truly accurate and objective reproduction was only possible with a camera. inspired by johannes overbeck, furtwängler also began using photographs. his work “masterpieces of greek sculpture” contained numerous large format images and furtwängler managed to establish the art of photography in archeology. photography enabled fragments to be compared closely, even when they were miles apart. perhaps the most famous example of furtwängler’s use of photography to reconstruct a statue, and identify it with descriptions by ancient authors, was the athena which three authors say pheidias cast in bronze for the islanders of lemnos to dedicate on the athenian acropolis in the mid 5th century. furtwängler was able to demonstrate that a marble head in bologna belonged to a marble body in dresden. the plaster cast in oxford unites the two. furtwängler concluded that the whole corresponded to descriptions by pausanias and others of the ‘fair’ athena who wore no helmet. the principal problem besetting the study of greek sculpture was not the fragmentary condition but the lack of originals. although ancient sources named famous sculptors and mentioned, or even described their work, most of the examples known to the 19th century were copies. at yovisto, you may be interested in a short video lecture on the history of photography.\\n',\n",
       " 'rembert dodoens and the love for botanical science.  rembert dodoens (1516-1585). on june 29, 1516, flemish physician and botanist rembert dodoens (dodonaeus) was born. his seminal work stirpium historiae pemptades sex sive libri xxx (1583) is considered one of the foremost botanical works of the late 16th century. he divided plants into 26 groups and introduced many new families. rembert dodoens was born under the name rembert van joenckema in mechelen, spanish netherlands, today flanders, belgium. later, he changed it to dodoens (“son of dodo”), dodo being a form of the first name of his father, denis van joenckema. the name was latinized into dodonaeus, from which the french, who were ignorant of its origins, further transformed it into dodonée. dodoens studied at the municipal college of mechelen and went from there to the university of louvain in 1530, where he studied medicine, cosmography and geography. according to the custom of the time, dodoens then traveled extensively. between 1535 and 1546 he was in italy, germany, and france. after these wanderjahren he returned to mechelen. in 1548 dodoens published a first book on cosmography, while in the same year he became one of the three municipal physicians of mechelen. during this time dodoens composed a treatise on physiology (published later) and began his botanical works. in the beginning of the sixteenth century, it was still believed that no plants existed other than those described by dioscorides in his materia medica of the first century ad. the great progress of natural sciences in the sixteenth century was helped by the discovery of printing and by the use of wood block illustrations. dodoens was a follower of the leading botanists of his time: otto brunfels and sprengel, the “german fathers of botany,” as well as jerome bock and leonhard fuchs. in 1552, dodoens’ first botanical work de frugum historia was published, a short treatise on cereals, vegetables, and fodders. in 1554, dodoens also published, as cruydeboek, a dutch version of leonard fuchs‘ de stirpium historia, a national herbarium devoted to species indigenous to the flemish provinces with 715 images. the merit of this book was that rather than proceeding by alphabetical order, as fuchs had done, dodoens grouped the plants according to their properties and their reciprocal affinities. dodoens treated in detail especially the medicinal herbs, which made this work, in the eyes of many, a pharmacopoeia. the book was translated first into french in 1557 by charles de l’ecluse (histoire des plantes), into english (via l’ecluse) in 1578 by henry lyte (a new herbal, or historie of plants), and later into latin in 1583. in his times, it was the most translated book after the bible. dodonea viscosa, named in honor of rembert dodoens dodoens turned down a chair at the university of leuven in 1557. in 1574 he left mechelen for vienna, where he had been appointed physician to the emperor maximilian ii. in cologne, he published in one volume a dissertation on wine and medical observations (1980) and synoptic tables on physiology (1581). then, he went to antwerp, where in 1582 he supervised the printing of his stirpium historiae pemptades sex sive libri xxx. in this elaborate treatise, dodoens’ most important scientific work, he divided plants into twentysix groups and introduced many new families, adding a wealth of illustration. he then became professor in medicine at the university of leiden in 1582, and remained there until his death. dodoens is commemorated in the plant genus dodonaea, which was named after him by carolus linnaeus. at yovisto, you can learn more about botany in the video lecture on ‘human livelihoods depend on wild flowers: kew’s millennium seed bank explained‘.\\n',\n",
       " 'maria goeppert mayer and the nuclear shell model.  maria goeppert mayer (1906-1972). on june 28, 1906, german born physicist maria goeppert mayer was born. she was awarded the nobel prize in physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. she was the second female nobel laureate in physics, after marie curie. maria goeppert was born in kattowitz, a city in prussia, the only child of friedrich goeppert and his wife maria. at age 4, she moved with her family to göttingen when her father was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the university of göttingen. goeppert was educated at the höhere technische schule in göttingen, a school for middle class girls who aspired to higher education. in 1921, she entered the frauenstudium, a private high school run by suffragettes that aimed to prepare girls for university. this school closed its doors during the economic inflation, but the teachers continued to give instructions to the pupils. maria goeppert finally took the abitur examination in hannover, in 1924, being examined by teachers she had never seen in her life. in the spring of 1924, goeppert entered the university of göttingen, where she studied mathematics. a purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a famous female professor of mathematics at göttingen, emmy noether. but, most girls were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificate and not in scientifc research. but, soon maria goeppert found herself more attracted to physics than to mathematics. this was the time when quantum mechanics was young and exciting. thus goeppert chose to pursue a ph.d. in theoretical physics. in her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two photon absorption by atoms. there were three nobel prize winners on the doctoral committee, max born, james franck and adolf windaus. nobel laureate eugene wigner later described the thesis as “a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness“. at the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two photon excited fluorescence was detected in a europium doped crystal. to honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two photon absorption cross section is named the goeppert mayer (gm) unit. shortly before she had met joseph edward mayer, an american rockefeller fellow working with james franck. in 1930 she went with him to the johns hopkins university in baltimore. this was the time of the depression, and no university would think of employing the wife of a professor. but she kept working, just for the fun of doing physics. there was little interest in quantum mechanics at johns hopkins, but goeppert mayer worked with karl herzfeld, collaborating on a number of papers. in 1939, mayer took up a position at columbia university, where the chairman of the physics department, george pegram, arranged for goeppert mayer to have an office, but again she received no salary. nevertheless, she had the chance to work together with physicist enrico fermi. in december 1941, goeppert mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part time at sarah lawrence college, and soon after she joined the manhattan project, where she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of uranium hexafluoride and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. in february 1945, goeppert mayer decided to join edward teller’s research group at the los alamos laboratory. in the late 1940s, goeppert mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, which she published in 1950. her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations. these numbers are what eugene wigner called magic numbers. three german scientists, otto haxel, j. hans d. jensen, and hans suess, were also working on solving the same problem, and arrived at the same conclusion independently. in 1963, goeppert mayer, jensen, and wigner shared the nobel prize for physics “for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure.” she was the second female nobel laureate in physics, after marie curie. at yovisto you may enjoy the video ‘the three lives of marie curie‘ by dr. serge plattard.  \\n',\n",

       " 'martin perl and the tau.  martin lewis perl (*1927) photo: nobelprize.org.  on june 24, 1927, american physicist and nobel laureate martin lewis perl was born. he is best known for his discovery of the tau lepton, a subatomic massive particle with a negative charge. the tau, which he found in the mid 1970s, was the first evidence of a third “generation” of fundamental particles. the tau lepton (?, also called the tau particle, tauon or simply tau) is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative electric charge and a spin of 1?2, but with 3477 times the mass. together with the electron, the muon, and the three neutrinos, it is classified as a lepton. two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. tau leptons have a very short lifetime of 2.9×10?13 s and a mass of 1776.82 mev/c2 (compared to 105.7 mev/c2 for muons and 0.511 mev/c2 for electrons). since their interactions are very similar to those of the electron, a tau can be thought of as a much heavier version of the electron. because of their greater mass, tau particles do not emit as much bremsstrahlung radiation as electrons; consequently they are potentially highly penetrating, much more so than electrons. however, because of their short lifetime, the range of the tau is mainly set by their decay length, which is too small for bremsstrahlung to be noticeable: their penetrating power appears only at ultra high energy. let’s take a look on the discovery of the tau and the man who succeeded to find it. martin perl was born on june 24, 1927 in new york city, new york to a family of jewish emigrants to the us from the polish area of russia. perl is a 1948 chemical engineering graduate of brooklyn polytechnic institute. after graduation, he worked for the general electric company, as a chemical engineer in a factory producing electron vacuum tubes. to learn about how the electron tubes worked, perl signed up for courses in atomic physics and advanced calculus at union college in schenectady, new york, which led to his growing interest in physics, and eventually to becoming a graduate student in physics in 1950. martin perl received his ph.d. from columbia university in 1955, where his thesis described measurements of the nuclear quadrupole moment of sodium, using the atomic beam resonance method that his advisor isaac i. rabi had won the nobel prize in phyics for in 1944. perl spent 8 years at the university of michigan, where he worked on the physics of strong interactions, using bubble chambers and spark chambers to study the scattering of pions and later neutrons on protons. seeking a simpler interaction mechanism to study, perl started to consider electron and muon interactions. he had the opportunity to start planning experimental work in this area when he moved in 1963 to the stanford linear accelerator center (slac), then being built in california. he was particularly interested in understanding the muon: why it should interact almost exactly like the electron but be 206.8 times heavier, and why it should decay through the route that it does. perl chose to look for answers to these questions in experiments on high energy charged leptons. in addition, he considered the possibility of finding a third generation of lepton through electron positron collisions. the tau was finally detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by perl with his colleagues at the slac lbl group. they were able to collide electrons and positrons at higher energies than had previously been possible, initially at up to 4.8 gev and eventually at 8 gev, energies high enough to lead to the production of a tau/antitau pair. because of the very short lifetime of the tau, these particles decayed within a few millimetres of the collision. hence perl and his coworkers did not detect the tau directly, but rather discovered anomalous events where they detected either an electron and a muon, or a positron and an antimuon. the symbol ? that was chosen for tau was derived from the greek ?????? (triton, meaning “third” in english), since it was the third charged lepton discovered. martin perl won the nobel prize in 1995 jointly with frederick reines. the prize was awarded “for pioneering experimental contributions to lepton physics”. perl received half “for the discovery of the tau lepton” while reines received his share “for the detection of the neutrino” at yovisto, you may learn more about particle physics in the inside tour of the world` biggest supercollider lch at the cern research institute, given by physicist brian cox.\\n',\n",

       " 'the discovery of charon.  artist’s concept of charon seen from the surface of pluto.  on june 22, 1978, us astronomer john christy discovered charon, the largest moon of pluto. although there was a discussion after the reclassification of pluto as a dwarf, charon is not in the list of dwarf planets currently recognized by the iau. on june 22, john christy had examined the magnified images of the former planet pluto, taken with the 61-inch flagstaff telescope two months prior. he noticed a periodically appearing elongation, which was confirmed shortly after. during subsequent studies, it was determined that the bulge was due to a smaller accompanying body. also, it was noticed that the periodicity of the bulge corresponded to pluto’s rotation period. between 1985 and 1990, pluto and charon entered a five year period of mutual eclipses and transits and all doubts about charon could be abolished. a few weeks after the united states naval observatory astronomer james christy had discovered pluto’s largest moon, charon, his achievement was officially announced by the international astronomical union. charon is half a big as pluto and it is assumed that its surface consists mostly of water ice. also, scientists believe that charon has no atmosphere. however, there are several theories on charon’s internal structure. it is believed that charon was created by a giant impact into pluto’s icy mantle and that it therefore consists of an icy body, containing less rock by proportion than its partner pluto. one theory suggests, that charon has a rocky core and an icy mantle, others believe charon to be of uniform composition throughout. pluto and charon are considered gravitationally locked, which means that each object keeps the same face towards the other. due to the fact that neither object orbits the other, many scientists argued that charon should be considered as a dwarf planet itself, however, the international astronomical union stated that charon is considered to be just a satellite of pluto. a side view of the pluto charon system image: stephanie hoover   at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture on ‘pluto, eris and the dwarf planets of the outer solar system‘ by professor mike brown.\\n',\n",

is best known for being one of the founders of chemical and medical research on antibiotics, esp. on penicillinum. “science, as long as it limits itself to the descriptive study of the laws of nature, has no moral or ethical quality and this applies to the physical as well as the biological sciences.” (sir ernst boris chain, in ‘social responsibility and the scientist’, new scientist, 22 october 1970, 166.) ernst boris chain was born in berlin, the son of margarete (née eisner) and michael chain, a russian born jewish immigrant who became a chemical engineer and built a successful chemical plant. the death of michael chain in 1919, coupled with the collapse of the post world war i german economy, depleted the family’s income so much that margarete chain had to open up her home as a guesthouse. one of chain’s primary interests during his youth was music, and for a while it seemed that he would embark on a career as a concert pianist. ernest b. chain was educated at the luisengymnasium, berlin, where he soon became interested in chemistry, stimulated by visits to his father’s laboratory and factory. he next attended the friedrich wilhelm university, berlin, where he graduated in chemistry in 1930. he was from an early age interested in biochemistry and after graduation he worked for three years at the charité hospital, berlin, on enzyme research. after the nazis came to power, chain knew that he, being jewish, would no longer be safe in germany. he left germany and moved to england, arriving on 2 april 1933 with ?10 in his pocket. geneticist and physiologist  haldane helped him obtain a position at university college hospital, london. he began working on phospholipids (a major component of all major biological membranes) as a phd student at fitzwilliam house, cambridge university under the direction of sir frederick gowland hopkins. in 1935, he accepted a job at oxford university as a lecturer in pathology. during this time he worked on a range of research topics, including snake venoms, tumor metabolism, lysozymes, and biochemistry techniques. in 1939, he joined howard florey to investigate natural antibacterial agents produced by microorganisms – among them penicillin. this led him and florey to revisit the work of alexander fleming, who had described penicillin nine years earlier. they mistakenly thought these substances were all enzymes like lysozyme. while florey and chain were assembling grants to support their research, work was begun on penicillin. chain and florey went on to discover penicillin’s therapeutic action and its chemical composition. he also theorized the structure of penicillin, which was confirmed by x ray crystallography done by dorothy hodgkin. for this research, chain, florey, and fleming received the nobel prize in 1945. chain, along with another chemist, edward penley abraham, worked out a successful technique for purifying and concentrating penicillin. the keys seemed to lie in controlling the ph of the “juice,” reducing the sample’s temperature, and evaporating the product over and over (essentially freeze drying it). in this early process many gallons of mold broth were used to produce an amount just large enough to cover a fingernail. this excruciatingly inefficient process was later improved on by norman heatley — another biochemist on the research team assembled by florey — and a succession of other scientists. towards the end of world war ii, chain learned his mother and sister had perished in the war. soon after world war ii, chain moved to rome, to work at the istituto superiore di sanità (superior institute of health). there, he productively combined a biochemical research department and a fermentation pilot plant. in 1957 a consulting relationship with a group of scientists from the beecham group, who came to rome especially to benefit from chain’s biochemical insights and the facilities there, resulted in the isolation of the atomic groupings central to the penicillin molecule. he returned to britain in 1964 as the founder and head of the biochemistry department at imperial college london, where he stayed until his retirement, specializing in fermentation technologies. in honor of his scientific achievements he was knighted soon after in 1969. always a person of many interests and projects, in his later life, his jewish identity became increasingly important to him. he became a member of the board of governors of the weizmann institute of science in 1954, and later a member of the executive council. his views were expressed most clearly in his speech ‘why i am a jew’ given at the world jewish congress conference of intellectuals in 1965. at yovisto you can learn more about infectious diseases and the importance of penicillin

very famous one about the berlin wall… on june 15, 1961, first secretary of the socialist unity party and german democratic republic state council chairman walter ulbricht stated in an international press conference, “niemand hat die absicht, eine mauer zu errichten!” (no one has the intention of erecting a wall!) of course you know that they did erect a wall in the middle of berlin, which divided the german capital for almost 30 years. after the end of world war ii in europe, what remained of pre war germany west of the oder neisse line was divided into four occupation zones, each one controlled by one of the four occupying allied powers. in the same way the capital of berlin was subdivided into four sectors despite the city’s location fully within the soviet zone. within two years, political divisions increased between the soviets and the other occupying powers. these included the soviets‘ refusal to agree to reconstruction plans making post war germany self sufficient and to a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the soviets. britain, france, the united states and the benelux countries later met to combine the non soviet zones of the country into one zone for reconstruction and to approve the extension of the marshall plan. in 1948, following disagreements regarding reconstruction and a new german currency, soviet leader joseph stalin instituted the berlin blockade, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in west berlin. the former western allies began a massive “airlift“, supplying west berlin with food and other supplies until in may 1949, stalin lifted the blockade, permitting the resumption of western shipments to berlin. on 7 october 1949, the german democratic republic (east germany) was declared. east germany differed from the western counterpart, the federal republic of germany, which developed into a western capitalist country with a social market economy and a democratic parliamentary government. continual economic growth starting in the 1950s fuelled a 20-year “economic miracle” (“wirtschaftswunder“) and as west germany’s economy grew, and its standard of living steadily improved, many east germans wanted to move to west germany. in the first 6 months of 1953 alone, more than 226000 had already fled. consequently, the inner german border between the two german states was closed, and a barbed wire fence erected. the border between the western and eastern sectors of berlin, however, remained open, although traffic between the soviet and the western sectors was somewhat restricted. this resulted in berlin becoming a magnet for east germans desperate to escape, and also a flashpoint for tension between the united states and the soviet union. in 1957, east germany introduced a new passport law that reduced the overall number of refugees leaving eastern germany with the result of drastically increasing the percentage of those leaving through west berlin from 60% to well over 90% by the end of 1958. despite heavy penalties, but with no physical barrier and subway train access still available to west berlin, such measures were ineffective. the emigrants tended to be young and well educated, leading to the “brain drain” feared by officials in east germany. an important reason that the west berlin border was not closed earlier was that doing so would cut off much of the railway traffic in east germany. with the construction of a new railway bypassing west berlin, the berlin outer ring, completed in 1961, closing the border became a more practical position. in particular the brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of east germany that the re securing of the german communist frontier was imperative. thus, on 15 june 1961, first secretary of the socialist unity party and gdr state council chairman walter ulbricht stated in an international press conference, “niemand hat die absicht, eine mauer zu errichten!“. it was the first time the colloquial term mauer (wall) had been used in this context. the record of a telephone call between nikita khrushchev and ulbricht on 1 august in the same year, suggests that it was from khrushchev that the initiative for the construction of the wall came. what is beyond dispute, though, is that ulbricht had pushed for a border closure for quite some time, arguing that east germany’s very existence was at stake. khrushchev had been emboldened by us president john f. kennedy’s tacit indication that the us would not actively oppose this action in the soviet sector of berlin. on saturday, 12 august 1961, while attending a garden party, ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a wall. at midnight, the police and units of the east german army began to close the border and, by sunday morning, 13 august, the border with west berlin was closed. east german troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the border to make them impassable to most vehicles and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the 156km around the three western sectors, as well as the 43km that divided west and east berlin. at yovisto, you can learn more about the border between the two former german states in the (german) short documentary from deutsche welle entitled “eingemauert!”

       " 'william butler yeats and modern english literature.  william butler yeats (1865-1939). photo: alice boughton, 1903.  on june 13, 1865, irish poet william butler yeats was born. yeats was a driving force behind the irish literary revival and has become one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. in 1923 he was awarded the nobel prize in literature. william butler yeats was born in sandymount, county dublin, ireland to john butler yeats, a lawyer and a well known portrait painter. yeats was educated in london and in dublin, but he spent his summers in the west of ireland in the family’s summer house at connaught. the young yeats was very much part of the fin de siècle in london; at the same time he was active in societies that attempted an irish literary revival. he spent his childhood in county sligo and in london. he returned to dublin at the age of fifteen to continue his education and study painting, but quickly discovered he preferred poetry. born into the anglo irish landowning class, yeats became involved with the celtic revival, a movement against the cultural influences of english rule in ireland during the victorian period, which sought to promote the spirit of ireland’s native heritage. at a young age he was reading dante alighieri, william shakespeare, john donne and the works of william blake and percy bysshe shelley, recommended by his father and inspiration for his own creativity. a devoted patriot, yeats found his voice to speak out against the harsh nationalist policies of the time. 1885 was an important year in yeats’s early adult life, marking the first publication, “the isle of statues“, a fantasy work that took edmund spenser for its poetic model in the dublin university review,and the beginning of his important interest in occultism. he read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the paranormal research organisation “the ghost club” and was especially influenced by the writings of emanuel swedenborg. also in 1885, yeats met john o’leary, a famous irish patriot who had returned to ireland after twenty years of imprisonment and exile for revolutionary nationalistic activities. o’leary had a keen enthusiasm for irish books, music, and ballads, and he encouraged young writers to adopt irish subjects. yeats, who had preferred more romantic settings and themes, soon took o’leary’s advice, producing many poems based on irish legends, irish folklore, and irish ballads and songs. in 1889, yeats published the wanderings of orisin, based on the lyrics of the fenian cycle of irish mythology and displays the influence of both sir samuel ferguson and the pre raphaelite poets. the wanderings of orisin was his first and probably the most extensive work, as he never attempted another. the poem was largely based upon the struggle of life, a theme that would frequently appear in his future works. during this period, he also wrote poems (1895), the secret rose (1897) and the wind among the reeds (1899). in 1885, yeats became a co founder of the dublin hermetic order and as a result, was made its chairman. at that time, he was also involved in the theosophical society and with hermeticism. in 1894 yeats became involved with the irish literary theatre, later becoming its chief playwright, with many of his plays being performed there and at the abbey theatre, also known as the national theatre of ireland which opened in 1904. yeats continued to publish throughout his life, and through the cuala press which he founded with his sisters in 1904, was also responsible for the publication of many other authors such as ezra pound. in 1889, yeats met maud gonne, a poet, feminist and a fervent nationalist. yeats became increasingly passionate about her who became his muse and source of unrequited love. he proposed marriage to her at least three times; in 1899, 1900 and 1901 and was rejected each time which was probably a result of his lack of enthusiasm to contribute in the revolutionary movement. in 1917, yeats married a friend george hyde lees whom he had met in 1911 at the age of 51. she shared yeats’ interest in mystical and esoteric subjects and helped him with the automatic writing. despite a huge age difference the marriage proved happy and the couple had two children. yeats was elected an irish senator in 1922, a post he filled until his retirement in 1928. he received the nobel prize in literature in 1923. his acceptance of the role and its responsibilities had been foreshadowed (predicted) in his poems responsibilities (1914). the outbreak of civil war in ireland in 1922 had heightened his conviction that the artist must lead the way through art, rather than through politics. in december 1923, yeats was awarded the nobel prize in literature, and was determined to make the most of the occasion. yeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the royal academy of sweden to present himself as a standard bearer of irish nationalism and irish cultural independence. yeats died in roquebrune, france, on january 28, 1939, where he had retired there because of ill health. he had the lines of one of his poems engraved on his tombstone in ireland: “cast a cold eye / on life, on death. / horseman, pass by!” at yovisto you can learn more about william butler yeats in the lecture of yale prof langdon hammer on modern poetry.\\n',\n",

       " 'life and legend of frederick barbarossa.  frederick sends out the boy to see whether the ravens still fly frederick i ‘barbarossa‘ in a typical folk tale on june 10, 1190, frederick i, emperor of the holy roman empire and better known as frederick barbarossa passed away. he died by drowning in the river saleph during the third crusade. he got the name barbarossa from the northern italian cities he attempted to rule: barbarossa means “red beard” in italian; in german, he was known as ‘kaiser rotbart‘, which has the same meaning. there was a time, when every german school kid knew the history of ‘kaiser rotbart‘, who had become a mythological figure, resting in his quiet rock tomb in the kyffhäuser mountain. according to folk lore, the ravens will watch over his tomb and keep on circling over the kyffhäuser, until he will awake from his thousand years sleep again to start his comeback. a legend, which was fostered by the literates of the romantic movement in 19th century germany. but, there is also a historical figure behind the legend. frederick was born in 1122. frederick’s father was from the hohenstaufen family, and his mother was from the welf family, the two most powerful families in germany. at age 25 he became duke of swabia in 1147, and shortly afterwards made his first trip to the east, accompanied by his uncle, the german king conrad iii, on the second crusade. the expedition proved to be a disaster, but frederick distinguished himself and won the complete confidence of the king. when conrad died in february 1152, only frederick and the prince bishop of bamberg were at his deathbed. both asserted afterwards that conrad had, in full possession of his mental powers, handed the royal insignia to frederick and indicated that frederick, rather than conrad’s own six year old son succeed him as king. on 4 march 1152 the kingdom’s princely electors in frankfurt designated frederick as the next german king, to be crowned king of the romans at aachen only several days later. the status of the german empire by that time was in disarray, its power waning under the weight of the investiture controversy with henry iv. the german monarchy was largely a nominal title with no real power. when frederick i of hohenstaufen was chosen as king in 1152, royal power had been in effective abeyance for over twenty five years. the only real claim to wealth lay in the rich cities of northern italy, which were still within the nominal control of the german king. in 1158 milan, the chief city of lombardy, revolted and over the alps came an army of a hundred thousand german soldiers, with frederick barbarossa at their head. after a long siege the city surrendered, but soon it revolted again. the emperor besieged it once more and once more it surrendered. its fortifications were destroyed and many of its buildings ruined. but even then the spirit of the lombards was not broken. milan and the other cities of lombardy united in a league and defied the emperor. he called upon the german dukes to bring their men to his aid. all responded except henry the lion, duke of saxony, frederick’s cousin. frederick is said to have knelt and implored henry to do his duty, but in vain. frederick’s campaign against the lombards failed and his army was completely defeated. on 9 june 1156 at würzburg, frederick married beatrice of burgundy, thus adding to his possessions the sizeable realm of the county of burgundy. he also declared himself the sole augustus of the roman world. in june 1158, barbarossa prepared a large expedition to italy. in the years since he was crowned, a growing rift had opened between the emperor and the pope. while barbarossa believed that the pope should be subject to the emperor, pope adrian claimed the opposite. marching into italy, barbarossa sought to reassert his imperial sovereignty. sweeping through the northern part of the country, he conquered city after city and occupied milan on september 7, 1158. as tensions grew, adrian considered excommunicating the emperor, however he died before taking any action. in september 1159, pope alexander iii was elected and immediately moved to claim papal supremacy over the empire. in response to alexander’s actions and his excommunication, barbarossa began supporting a series of antipopes. in 1166, barbarossa attacked towards rome at won a decisive victory at the battle of monte porzio. his success proved short lived as disease ravaged his army and he was forced to retreat back to germany. remaining in his realm for six years, he worked to improve diplomatic relations with england, france, and the byzantine empire. though barbarossa had reconciled with the pope, he continued to take actions to strengthen his position in italy. in 1183, he signed a treaty with the lombard league, separating them from the pope. after the christians had held jerusalem for eighty eight years, it was recaptured by the moslems under the lead of the famous saladin , in the year 1187. there was much excitement in christendom, and the pope proclaimed another crusade. frederick immediately raised an army of crusaders in the german empire and with one hundred and fifty thousand men started for palestine. he marched into asia minor, attacked the moslem forces, and defeated them in two great battles. on 10 june 1190, emperor frederick’s career was put to an end when he drowned in the saleph river. he had decided to walk his horse through the river instead of crossing the bridge that had been too crowded with troops. the current was too strong for the horse to handle, and his suit armour was too heavy for him to swim in: both were swept away and drowned. some historians believe he may have had a heart attack that complicated matters. some of frederick’s men put him in a barrel of vinegar to preserve his body. in the empire the dead emperor was long mourned and for many years the peasants believed that frederick was not really dead, but was asleep in a cave in the kyffhäuser mountain in germany, with his gallant knights around him. he was supposed to be sitting in his chair of state, with the crown upon his head, his eyes half closed in slumber, his beard as white as snow and so long that it reached the ground. “when the ravens cease to fly round the mountain,” said the legend, “barbarossa shall awake and restore germany to its ancient greatness.” even today you will find references to the legendary emperor in literature. umberto eco made frederick barbarossa to one of his protagonists in his historical novel

       " 'johann gottfried galle and planet neptune.  neptune compared to earth.  on june 9, 1812, german astronomer johann gottfried galle was born. galle actually was the first person to view the planet neptune and know what he was looking at, by making use of the calculations of his fellow astronomer urbain le verrier. johann gottfried galle studied at the friedrich wilhelms universität berlin between 1839 and 1833 and started to work at the new berlin observatory two years later. there, he worked for 16 years and made several discoveries at the observatory. galle made use especially of a fraunhofer refractor with 22,5 cm aperture. in 1838 he discovered an inner, dark ring of saturn. from 2 december 1839 to 6 march 1840 he discovered three new comets. he completed his doctoral thesis on ole rømer’s observation of meridian transits of stars and planets on the days from 20 october to 23 october 1706 through critically discussing his findings. his dissertation was also sent to urbain le verrier, who took one year to answer. in his returning letter, le verrier explained that he had been investigating the perturbations of the orbit of the planet uranus and from this he derived the position of a still undiscovered planet. he was not alone with his observation, since also french astronomer alexis bouvard noticed changes in the orbit of uranus which led him to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. le verrier asked galle to search in the corresponding section of the sky and in collaboration with his assistant heinrich louis d’arrest.  on september 23, 1846, galle discovered a star of 8th magnitude, only 1° away from the calculated position, which was not recorded in the berliner akademischen sternkarte. over the following two evenings, the object could be determined as a planet through the measurement of its motion. galle always refused to be acknowledged as the discoverer of neptune and attributed the discovery to le verrier. after neptune’s discovery, the planet was referred to as “the planet exterior to uranus” or as “le verrier’s planet“. in england, cambridge observatory director james challis put forward the name oceanus. galle then suggested the name ‘janus‘, but later on, le verrier claimed his right to name his discovered planet neptune. after further quarrels, the name became widely accepted in the international scientific community. in roman mythology, neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the greek poseidon. the demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for earth, were named for deities in greek and roman mythology. from its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of pluto in 1930, neptune was the farthest known planet. upon pluto’s discovery neptune became the penultimate planet. however, in 2006, the international astronomical union defined the word “planet” for the first time, reclassifying pluto as a “dwarf planet” and making neptune once again the last planet in the solar system. at yovisto, you may be interested in a short but highly interesting explanation of the discovery of neptune.\\n',\n",
       " 'the viking raid on the abbey of lindisfarne.  lindisfarne, painting by thomas girtin, 1798.  on 8 june, 793 ad, vikings destroyed the abbey on lindisfarne, a centre of learning that was famous across the continent. this event also is considered as the beginning of the viking age, when scandinavian norsemen explored europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids and conquest. recently, this first viking assault has gained more public interest because of the popular tv series “vikings” (“wrath of the northmen”), in which the semi legendary ragnar lodbrok organises and leads the 793 attack on the priory by a small band of vikings who head west, arrive on the shores of lindisfarne, and shortly thereafter conduct the raid. but, today we want to take a look on the historical facts. the island of lindisfarne (also called holy island of lindisfarne or simply holy island) is a tidal island off the northeast coast of england. it constitutes the civil parish of holy island in northumberland and has a recorded history from the 6th century. it was an important centre of celtic christianity under saints aidan, cuthbert, eadfrith and eadberht. the northeast coast of england had been little settled in roman times and apart from the tyne valley and the wall, little affected during the centuries of nominal roman occupation. king ida (reigned from 547) started the sea borne settlement of the coast establishing a urbs regia at bamburgh across the bay from lindisfarne. the conquest was not straight forward however, the historia brittonum recounts how in the 6th century, urien, prince of rheged, besieged the angles led by theodoric at the island for three days and three nights. the monastery of lindisfarne was founded by irish monk saint aidan, who had been sent from iona off the west coast of scotland to northumbria at the request of king oswald. the priory was founded before the end of 634 and remained the only seat of a bishopric in northumbria for nearly thirty years. lindisfarne became the base for christian evangelising in the north of england. monks from the irish community of iona settled on the island. northumberland’s patron saint, saint cuthbert, who later also became bishop of lindisfarne, was a monk and later abbot of the monastery, and his miracles and life are recorded by the venerable bede. an anonymous life of cuthbert written at lindisfarne is the oldest extant piece of english historical writing. at some point in the early 700s the famous illuminated manuscript known as the lindisfarne gospels, an illustrated latin copy of the gospels of matthew, mark, luke and john, was made probably at lindisfarne. in 793, the viking raid on lindisfarne caused much consternation throughout the christian west. a description of the raid is recorded in “history of the church of durham” by the monk simeon: on the seventh of the ides of june, they reached the church of lindisfarne, and there they miserably ravaged and pillaged everything; they trod the holy things under their polluted feet, they dug down the altars, and plundered all the treasures of the church. some of the brethren they slew, some they carried off with them in chains, the greater number they stripped naked, insulted, and cast out of doors, and some they drowned in the sea. the devastation of northumbria’s holy island shocked and alerted the royal courts of europe to the viking presence. alcuin, a northumbrian scholar in charlemagne’s court at the time, wrote: never before has such terror appeared in britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race…the heathens poured out the blood of saints around the altar, and trampled on the bodies of saints in the temple of god, like dung in the streets. the vikings robbed the monastery of all the valuables they could get their hands on, but there were two important treasures they overlooked – the beautiful, handwritten and illuminated bible “the lindisfarne gospels”, and the exquisite carved oak coffin containing the relics of st. cuthbert. the lindisfarne gospels are today exhibited in the british museum in london, while the relics of st. cuthbert are kept in durham cathedral, where they were brought after the viking raid. more than any other single event, the attack on lindisfarne demonised perception of the vikings for the next twelve centuries. not until the 1890s did scholars outside scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the vikings, recognizing their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship. in england, many monasteries were established on islands, peninsulas, river mouths and cliffs. isolated communities were less susceptible to interference and the politics of the heartland. the amazement of the english at the raids from the sea must have been matched by the amazement of the raiders at such (to them) vulnerable, wealthy and unarmed settlements. these preliminary raids, unsettling as they were, were not followed up. the main body of the raiders passed north around scotland. with the raid on lindisfarne the viking age of scandinavian history and expansion began. viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the shetland, orkney, and faroe islands; iceland; greenland; and l’anse aux meadows, a short lived settlement in newfoundland, circa 1000. at yovisto you can learn more about the emergence of the vikings from scandinavia in the ninth and tenth centuries in the lecture ‘vikings‘ from the series ‘the early middle ages’ by yale prof paul freedman.\\n',\n",

       " 'thomas mann and the mann family.  thomas mann (1875-1955). photo: library of congress.  on june 6, 1875, german novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, and nobel laureate thomas mann was born. his highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas, are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. his older brother was the radical writer heinrich mann and three of his six children, erika mann, klaus mann and golo mann, also became important german writers. in germany, his novells have become a canonical reference. everybody knows the buddenbrock family and the story of their decline from a wealthy merchant family to mere insignificance. or the story of hans castorp, the eternal patient of the magic mountain, curing his tuberculosis – but in general also his mind – in switzerland. or do you know the infamous imposter felix krull, thomas mann’s last and unfinished novel? well, let’s have a closer look on this literary giant of the 20th century. mann was born paul thomas mann in lübeck, germany and was the second son of thomas johann heinrich mann, a senator and a grain merchant, and his wife júlia da silva bruhns, a brazilian of german and portuguese ancestry who emigrated to germany when seven years old. mann’s father died in 1891 and his trading firm was liquidated. the family subsequently moved to munich. mann attended the science division of a lübeck gymnasium (school). after finishing school rather ingloriously, he became a clerk in the office of a munich insurance company whose director had been a friend of my father’s. later, by way of preparing for a career in journalism, thomas mann studied history, economics, art history and literature at the ludwig maximillians university of munich and technical university of munich. the start of his writing career was with a short story ‘little mr. friedemann’ published in 1898. mann started writing his first novel in 1896 ‘buddonbrooks’, the a story about a merchant family which grabbed the interest of the public making mann rich and famous. buddenbrooks had gone through fifty editions in german before it was translated into english in 1924. american and british critics at the time compared it with john galsworthy’s “the forsyte saga,” also telling the story of a family through several generations. what made buddenbrooks particularly interesting to the literary student was the fact that the author, showing the social decline of a luebeck senatorial family, wove much of his own family history into the story. his reputation as a writer escalated with his novel ‘death in venice’ published in 1912. this book described the experiences of a writer who goes to venice and falls in love with a young boy. many of his works revolved around homosexual themes. however, mann married katia pringsheim, who belonged to a strong wealthy jewish background, and they had six children. in 1924, mann finally published what many consider to be his greatest work, the magic mountain. the novel is set in a tuberculosis sanatorium in the swiss alps, a community that represents a microcosm of europe directly before world war i. the protagonist, a healthy young man, comes to the sanatorium for a short visit, but ends up staying for seven years. eventually, he finds fulfillment by leaving the community. the novel typifies the style that mann is best known for: ironical, somber, and symbolic. in 1929, mann had a cottage built in the fishing village of nidden (nida, lithuania) on the curonian spit, where there was a german art colony and where he spent the summers of 1930–1932 working on joseph and his brothers, a tetralogy on the history of the biblical character. in 1933, while traveling in the south of france, mann heard from his children klaus and erika in munich, that it would not be safe for him to return to germany. the family (except the two oldest children) emigrated to küsnacht, near zurich, switzerland but received czechoslovak citizenship and a passport in 1936. he then emigrated to the united states in 1939, where he taught at princeton university. although mann was not a political writer, he was forced to move on a number of occasions for political reasons. he taught at princeton university in new jersey for two years, but moved to pacific palisades, california to join an expatriate community of german intelligentsia including the composer arnold schoenberg, dramatist berthold brecht, and mann’s own brother, heinrich. in his famous doctor faustus (1947), mann retold the famous myth as a composer who sells his soul to the devil in return for fame. based on his friend, composer arnold schoenberg, the work expresses mann’s despair over german nazism. after world war ii, during the mccarthy era, mann grew disillusioned with american politics and moved back to europe in 1952. his most important german visit was in 1949, at the 200th birthday of johann wolfgang von goethe, attending celebrations in frankfurt am main and weimar, as a statement that german culture extended beyond the new political borders. thomas mann died in zurich on august 12, 1955. at yovisto you can learn more about thomas mann in a seminar by the goethe institute boston on thomas mann and his stories.\\n',\n",
       " 'the bose einstein condensate brings quantum theory to the macroscopic scale.  velocity distribution data (3 views) for a gas of rubidium atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the bose–einstein condensate. on june 5, 1995, the very first bose einstein condensate was experimentally produced by eric cornell and carl wieman at the university of colorado. a bose–einstein condensate (bec) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale. for their achievements cornell, wieman, and wolfgang ketterle at mit received the 2001 nobel prize in physics. in the early 1920s indian physicist satyendra nath bose was studying the new idea that the light came in little discrete packets, today called “photons“. bose assumed certain rules for deciding when two photons should be counted up as either identical or different. we now call these rules “bose statistics” (or sometimes “bose einstein statistics“). bose first sent a paper to famous albert einstein on the quantum statistics of those light quanta. einstein was so impressed that he translated the paper himself from english to german and submitted it for bose to the zeitschrift für physik, which published it. einstein major contribution then was his extension of bose’s ideas to material particles, which he published in two other papers. the result of the efforts of bose and einstein is the concept of a bose gas, governed by bose–einstein statistics, which describes the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer spin, now known as bosons. bosonic particles, which include the photon as well as atoms such as helium 4 (4he), are allowed to share quantum states with each other. einstein proposed that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or “condense”) into the lowest accessible quantum state, resulting in a new form of matter. if the atoms were cold enough, something very unusual was supposed to happen. it was so strange that einstein was not really sure whether his solution was correct. in 1938 fritz london proposed bec as a mechanism for superfluidity in 4he and superconductivity, discovered in the same year by, pyotr kapitsa, john allen and don misener. they discovered that helium 4 became a new kind of fluid, now known as a superfluid, at temperatures less than 2.17 k (the so called lambda point). superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. it was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial bose–einstein condensation of the liquid. but it took almost 60 years, until in 1995 the first gaseous condensate was produced by eric cornell and carl wieman at the university of colorado at boulder nist–jila lab, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvin (nk). for their achievements cornell, wieman, and wolfgang ketterle at mit received the 2001 nobel prize in physics. at yovisto, you can listen to nobel laureate wolfgang ketterle in the mit documentation ‘the coldest place in the universe‘ and learn more about the bose einstein condensate.\\n',\n",

       " 'the novels of thomas hardy.  thomas hardy (1840-1928). on june 2, 1840, english novelist and poet thomas hardy was born. a victorian realist in the tradition of george eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by romanticism, especially william wordsworth. charles dickens was his other source of influence, and like dickens he was highly critical of much in victorian society. thomas hardy was born in the village of upper bockhampton, located in southwestern england. his father was a stone mason and a violinist, while his mother enjoyed reading and relating all the folk songs and legends of the region. at the age of eight, hardy began to attend julia martin’s school in bockhampton. however, most of his education came from the books he found in dorchester, the nearby town. he learned french, german, and latin by teaching himself through these books. because hardy’s family lacked the means for a university education, his formal education ended at the age of sixteen, when he became apprenticed to james hicks, a local architect. under hicks’ tutelage, hardy learned much about architectural drawing and restoring old houses and churches. hardy loved the apprenticeship because it allowed him to learn the histories of the houses and the families that lived there. in 1862, he moved to london, where he enrolled as a student at king’s college london. he won prizes from the royal institute of british architects and the architectural association. but hardy never felt at home in london, because he was acutely conscious of class divisions and his social inferiority. however, during this time he became interested in social reform and the works of john stuart mill, maybe the most influential english speaking philosopher of the 19th century. he was also introduced by his dorset friend horace moule to the works of charles fourier, a french philosopher credited with having originated the word feminism, and auguste comte, one of the founders of the discipline of sociology and of the doctrine of positivism. five years later in 1867, concerned about his health, hardy returned to dorset and decided to dedicate himself to entirely writing poetry and novels, though the first part of his career was devoted to the novel. at first he published anonymously, but when people became interested in his works, he began to use his own name. like dickens, hardy’s novels were published in serial forms in magazines that were popular in both england and america. his first popular novel was under the greenwood tree, published in 1872. the next great novel, far from the madding crowd (1874) was so popular that with the profits, hardy was able to give up architecture and marry emma gifford. other popular novels followed in quick succession: the return of the native (1878), the mayor of casterbridge (1886), the woodlanders (1887), tess of the d’urbervilles (1891), and jude the obscure (1895). in addition to these larger works, hardy published three collections of short stories and five smaller novels, all moderately successful. however, despite the praise hardy’s fiction received, many critics also found his works to be too shocking, especially tess of the d’urbervilles and jude the obscure. the outcry against jude was so great that hardy decided to stop writing novels and return to his first great love, poetry. hardy’s long career spanned the victorian and the modern eras. he described himself as a poet “who holds that if way to the better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst” and during his nearly 88 years he lived through too many upheavals — including world war i — to have become optimistic with age. incredibly prolific, hardy wrote fourteen novels, three volumes of short stories, and several poems between the years 1871 and 1897. from 1898 until his death in 1928 hardy published eight volumes of poetry; about one thousand poems were published in his lifetime. moreover, between 1903 and 1908 hardy published the dynasts—a huge poetic drama in 3 parts, 19 acts, and 130 scenes. although hardy’s novels were received badly by critics when they were first published, hardy has been consistently recognized since his death as one of the great english novelists. he was an important influence on modernism, and many later writers, including virginia woolf,  lawrence, and robert graves, named hardy as influences. at yovisto you can learn more about the poetry ofthomas hardy in the lecture of prof langdon hammer from yale university on ‘world war i poetry in england‘.\\n',\n",
       " 'carnot and thermodynamics.  nicolas léonard sadi carnot (1796-1832).  on june 1, 1796, french military engineer and physicist nicolas léonard sadi carnot was born. he is often described as the “father of thermodynamics“. in particular, carnot gave the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines. carnot’s work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by rudolf clausius and lord kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy. sadi carnot was the eldest son of lazare carnot and he was born in the palais du petit luxembourg. at the time of sadi’s birth, his father was an eminent mathematician, military engineer, and a member of the directory, the french revolutionary government which lasted four years from november 1795 to november 1799. sadi was named after a medieval persian poet and philosopher called sa’di of shiraz. it was a time of unrest and political turmoil in france and, due the position of his father, whose fortunes changed dramatically many times, he was brought up in a totally unstable environment of interacting politics and science. at the age of 16, sadi carnot became a cadet in the école polytechnique in paris, which was intended to train engineers for military service, but its professors included such eminent scientists as andré-marie ampère, françois arago, joseph louis gay lussac, and siméon denis poisson. after graduating in 1814, sadi became an officer in the french army’s corps of engineers. because his father lazare had served as napoleon’s minister of the interior during the “hundred days“, he was forced into exile after napoleon’s final defeat in 1815. therefore, also sadi’s position in the army under the restored bourbon monarchy of louis xviii became increasingly difficult. in 1819, sadi transferred to the newly formed general staff, in paris. he remained on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits. he befriended the scientist nicolas clément and attended lectures on physics and chemistry. more and more, he became interested in understanding the limitation to improving the performance of steam engines, which led him to the investigations that became his reflections on the motive power of fire, published in 1824, considered the founding work of thermodynamics. steam engines had achieved widely recognized economic and industrial importance, but there had been no real scientific study of them. although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. in 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades. in his main work reflections on the motive power of fire carnot sought to answer two questions about the operation of heat engines: “is the work available from a heat source potentially unbounded?” and “can heat engines in principle be improved by replacing the steam with some other working fluid or gas?” the book was plainly intended to cover a rather wide range of topics about heat engines in a rather popular fashion, the most important part of the book was devoted to an abstract presentation of an idealized engine that could be used to understand and clarify the fundamental principles that are generally applied to all heat engines, independent of their design. this resulted in a model thermodynamic system upon which exact calculations could be made. by idealizing the engine, he could arrive at clear and indisputable answers to his original two questions. in carnot’s idealized model, the caloric transported from a hot to a cold body, yielding work, could be transported back by reversing the motion of the cycle, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. carnot retired from the army in 1828, without a pension. he was interned in a private asylum in 1832 as suffering from “mania” and “general delirum”. he died during a cholera epidemic in 1832, at the age of only 36. because of the contagious nature of cholera, many of carnot’s belongings and writings were buried together with him after his death. as consequence, only a handful of his scientific writings survived. it is likely that carnot would have made many more significant scientific contributions had his life not been so tragically short. his work was only taken seriously after his early death. emile clapeyron, a fellow student from ecole polytechnique translated carnot’s book into mathematical terms and more than a decade later rudolf clausius and lord kelvin extended carnot’s work into what is present day thermodynamics. at yovisto you might learn more about the principles behind steam engines and thermodynamics in the lecture videos of prof. ranamurti shankar from yale on ‘fundamentals of physics‘, where he also discusses the laws of thermodynamics.\\n',\n",
       " 'the poetry of walt whitman.  walt whitman (1819 – 1892). on may 31, 1819, american poet, essayist and journalist walt whitman was born. whitman is among the most influential poets in the american canon, often called the father of free verse. a humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works.  walt whitman ended his formal education at the age of 11 in order to work and support his large family financially. first, he was an office boy and later he was apprenticed at the weekly long island newspaper, the patriot. it is assumed that occasionally, he was able to write filler material for the paper. before he turned 16, whitman took a position at the shop of alden spooner, editor of the leading whig weekly newspaper the long island star, where he began attending theater performances, joined a town debating society, and and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry.  the young poet then moved to new york city in order to find some work as a compositor, but had some difficulties. after this failed attempt, whitman moved back in with his family at long island and started a teaching career. in the following period, whitman started an attempt to create his own newspaper, but was again forced to teach. still, he published a series of ten editorials, called “sun down papers—from the desk of a schoolmaster“, between the winter of 1840 and july 1841. he went back to new york to work for several newspapers, with modest success. still, he determined to become a poet and in 1850, he began writing what would become leaves of grass, a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death. at the end of june 1855, whitman surprised his brothers with the already printed first edition of leaves of grass. unfortunately, his brother george “didn’t think it worth reading”. however, the book received a good attention and was praised the most by ralph waldo emerson, who wrote a flattering five page letter to whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends. the more critical responses tended to focus on the potentially offensive sexual themes.  whitman was highly influenced by the civil war. he was worried that his brother was wounded and made his way to find him. luckily, george had only small wounds, but seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs affected the author. whitman volunteered as a nurse in army hospitals and published a book called ‘memoranda during the war‘ about 12 years later. whitman soon started working for the government, but was fired on june 30, 1865, presumably because of his 1860 edition of leaves of grass. however, his friend douglas o’connor highly protested and published a biased and exaggerated biographical study, the good gray poet, in january 1866, which defended whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet’s nickname and increased his popularity. also important for whitman’s fame in this period was the publication of “o captain! my captain!“, the famous poem on the death of abraham lincoln. poems of walt whitman was published in 1868 in england, which became highly popular.  due to his declining health, whitman moved in with his brother and still was very productive in this period, publishing three versions of leaves of grass among other works. he was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both oscar wilde and thomas eakins. after whitman had moved into his own house, he prepared a final edition of leaves of grass, a version that has been nicknamed the “deathbed edition”.  walt whitman passed away on march 26, 1892  at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture on walt whitman and the civil war by terrence pratt.\\n',\n",

and stunt pilot elly beinhorn was born. in the 1930s she broke several long distance flight records including flying over three continents in a single day. when it comes to the history of aviation, there seem to be less gender issues compared to other technological disciplines, as our growing list of women aviation pioneers here at yovisto blog can proof (cf. below). we already reported on amy johnson and her flight to australia as well as about famous amelia earhart, who got lost during one of her record breaking flights over the pacific. today, we want to draw the focus to a german aviatrix, elly beinhorn. there is actually also a personal connection with today’s story, because my grandmother made a piloting license for gliders back in the 1930s. from her tellings when i was a child, i know that she pretty much admired elly beinhorn as an example for her own ambitions. an only child, elly beinhorn was born into a merchant family in hannover, germany, where she grew up dreaming of travel and adventure in foreign lands. at the age of 20, she attended a lecture by famed aviator hermann köhl, who had recently completed a historic east west atlantic crossing, which must have been the initial spark that ignited her lifelong interest in aviation. on the next day, elly was reporting to the president of the aviation club in hannover to take flying lessons. but, he tried to persuade her that as being a woman she would have no chance to get a job as an aviator. nevertheless, elly was sticking to her idea. her mother was crying and her father doubted about her reasoning. against all odds, with funds from a small inheritance she moved to spandau in berlin where she took flying lessons, at berlin staaken airport, under the tutelage of instructor otto thomsen. she soon made her solo flight in a small klemm kl 20. with her money running out, it was suggested that she give aerobatic displays on the weekends. she found this financially rewarding, but personally unsatisfying. long distance flying should become her real passion and in 1931 she seized the opportunity to fly to portuguese guinea, west africa on a scientific expedition. on the return journey, engine failure resulted in a crash landing in the sahara. with the help of nomadic tuareg tribesmen, elly joined a camel caravan to timbuktu. she subsequently returned to the crash site to recover parts of the plane. word of her plight reached the french authorities and they sent a military two seater plane to collect her. in april 1931, fully recovered, she was able to fly herself back to berlin to a warm reception from the crowds. soon after this, she embarked on another flight, her klemm monoplane developing mechanical problems near bushire, persia. she found moye stephens, another pilot, in bushire, who helped her fix the problem on her klemm. stephens and travel adventure writer richard halliburton were flying around the world in a stearman c 3b biplane, they called the flying carpet. she accompanied them on part of their flight, including the trip to mount everest. she flew on to bali – and eventually australia. in the process, she became only the second woman to fly solo from europe to australia, after amy johnson. having landed in darwin, north australia, elly headed down to sydney, arriving in march 1932. her plane was dismantled and shipped to new zealand, then panama where it was reassembled. there elly resumed her flight, following the western coast of south america, where she was presented with a medal in peru. an ill advised trip across the andes followed. the plane was dismantled once more in brazil and shipped to germany. elly arrived in berlin in june 1932. now famous but in debt to the tune of 15000 marks or more, she was pleasantly surprised to be awarded the hindenburg cup, 10000 marks and several other monetary awards from the german aeronautical industry which enabled her to continue her career. she also continued to write articles and sell photographs of her travels to raise funds. free of debt, she took off for africa using a heinkel he 71, flying down the east coast, then back up the west coast. the following year, elly shipped the plane to panama, then flew through mexico and california before crossing the united states to washington dc and miami. elly and the plane returned to germany by ship, arriving in january 1935. she was now a true german heroine. on 29 september 1935 elly attended the grand prix, held in the town of brno in czechoslovakia. she congratulated the winner, bernd rosemeyer, who seemed smitten with her. they danced together that night and were married on 13 july 1936. a true celebrity couple – an adventurous aviator and the fearless racing driver – they were the toast of nazi germany. heinrich himmler ordered a reluctant bernd to become a member of the ss. just ten weeks after the birth of their son in 1937, rosemeyer was killed while attempting a speed record. as a national hero he was mourned by much of germany. after world war ii she briefly took up gliding due to the ban on powered flight in germany. but she soon moved to switzerland to continue flying planes. in 1979, at the age of 72, she surrendered her pilot’s licence. elly beinhorn died on 28 november 2007, at the age of 100. at yovisto, you may be interested in extracts of interviews with elly

on time. after several further crimes, he was sent to eastham prison farm and there, he was sexually abused in and killed one man for doing so. his sister stated that “something awful sure must have happened to him in prison, because he wasn’t the same person when he got out“. barrow continued his ‘career’ robbing grocery stores and gas stations, but it was said that “barrow’s goal in life was

their robberies including lawmen and by then, clyde was accused of murder for the first time. bonnie and clyde brushed the law quite often already in this period. the gang attracted the police’s attention while discharging an automatic rifle while someone cleaned it. the officers assembled a five man force in two cars on to confront what they suspected were bootleggers living in the garage apartment. the gang killed the detective and wounded another officer immediately and they fled the apartment while getting wounded themselves as well. the gang left most of their belongings including weapons, poems by bonnie, undeveloped film rolls and official documents in the apartment. the group became quickly known as the barrow gang across the country. they continued their robberies ranging from texas to minnesota, not hesitating to kill or wound anyone. however, life got more and more difficult as the crimes continued. they avoided public places and got used to washing themselves in the rivers as well as preparing their food over camp fires. in 1933, the gang checked into the red crown tourist court in missouri and started to attract attention through the way they dressed and behaved. quickly, the police put the cabins under surveillance and shortly after the sheriff led a group of officers armed with thompson submachine guns toward the cabins. this time, the gang was not as successful evading the law. one member was shot in the head and died a few days after surgery and another was captured. the remaining trio ranged far afield from their usual area of operations. when another member of the gang got arrested, bonnie and clyde were the only remaining gang members for a while. in january 1934, clyde organized a jailbreak for raymond hamilton. during the attempt, prison officer major joe crowson was shot, which resulted in a full power manhunt by the texas and federal governments. former texas ranger captain frank hamer was contacted and persuaded to hunt down the barrow gang. in april of the same year, bonnie and clyde were accused of firing fatal shots at two young highway patrolmen and a 1000 usd reward was offered for the couple’s bodies. the public hostility towards the gang increased when a widower single father was killed. hamer started tracking the gang in february, 1934 and studied their movements. the gang’s itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see their new partner’s family in louisiana. hamer expected this, and had obtained a quantity of civilian browning automatic rifles and 20-round magazines with armor piercing rounds. the posse concealed in the bushes, knowing the couple’s approximate location. when clyde approached with his stolen ford v8, the lawmen opened fire, killing bonnie and clyde while shooting a combined total of about 130 rounds. researchers have said bonnie and clyde were shot more than fifty times and the officers inspected the vehicle and discovered an arsenal of weapons, including stolen automatic rifles, sawed off semi automatic shotguns, assorted handguns, and several thousand rounds of ammunition, along with 15 sets of license plates from various states. a large crowd gathered at the scene and policemen had to guard the bodies. still, a woman managed to cut off bloody locks of bonnie’s hair and pieces from her dress, which were then sold. one man even attempted to to cut off clyde’s trigger finger. within hours, the small town was estimated to swell in population from 2000 to 12000. at yovisto, you may be interested in video footage recorded

       " 'hergé and the adventures of tintin.  hergé’s signature.  on may 22, 1907, belgian cartonist georges prosper remi, better known under his pen name hergé, was born. his best known and most substantial work is the 23 completed comic books in the adventures of tintin series. georges prosper remi grew up in the suburbs of brussels, belgium, which he considered as extremely boring. however, he developed a great interest in movies, especially the ones of charlie chaplin and winsor mccay’s gertie the dinosaur. furthermore, he enjoyed british and american novels like huckleberry finn, treasure island, robinson crusoe and the pickwick papers. he also began to sketch out scenes from his everyday life, which increased his enthusiasm in drawing. he was highly supported by his boy scout master, who published one of his drawings in a newsletter. further publications in the belgian boy scout newsletter followed and the young artist began experimenting with several pseudonyms, such as “jérémie” or “jérémiades“. “hergé” is based on the pronunciation of his reversed initials () and he first used his now famous pseudonym in december 1924. hergé’s first published comic strip was titled “les aventures de totor,  des hannetons” and revolved around the adventures of a boy scout patrol leader. he also sought guidance from an older cartoonist, pierre ickx, and together they founded the short lived atelier de la fleur de lys, an organisation for christian cartoonists. the young artist enrolled at in the école saint luc art school, which he found boring and left after only one lesson. due to his boredom, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in august 1926 was assigned to the dailly barracks at schaerbeek. he was still bored by the military training, but in his free time, he managed to continue sketching and producing episodes of totor. when he met the editor of le xxe siecle, the abbé norbert wallez, he was hired as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper. in 1928, wallez founded a newpaper supplement for children, le petit vingtième. it appeared once a week and hergé illustrated l’extraordinaire aventures de flup, nénesse, puosette et cochonet for the paper. however, he increasingly felt the need to publish a comic strip of his own. the front page of the 1 may 1930 edition of le petit vingtième declared that “tintin revient!” (“tintin returns!”) from his adventure in the soviet union. the famous tintin character was born. he was a belgian boy reporter who traveled the world with his fox terrier, milou. although hergé wanted to send his character to the united states, wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the soviet union. the story was published as a series and even a book of tintin’s adventured followed shortly after, which increased his fame even more. in his next adventure, the character was sent to congo. unfortunately, in later decades the story would be accused of racism, but at the time, it was un controversial and popular. tintin in america was serialized from september 1931 to october 1932. hergé became quite famous and international newspapers started requesting his works. further works of the period were the lovable mr. mops and the adventures of tim the squirrel out west. from august 1934 to october 1935, le petit vingtième serialised tintin’s next adventure, the blue lotus. it was set in china and hergé’s production work was highly influenced by his friend zhang chongren, a catholic chinese student. zhang gave him lessons in taoist philosophy, chinese art, and chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style but also his general outlook on life. hergé added another character to his series, a young chinese boy named chang chong chen who meets and befriends tintin. the blue lotus has been widely considered as “hergé’s first masterpiece“, due to high attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of china. in 1936, they also began production of tintin merchandise, something hergé supported,. he even developed the idea of an entire shop devoted to the adventures of tintin, which was accomplished about 50 years later. hergé was mobilized as a reserve lieutenant during the second world war and had to interrupt tintin’s adventures. le petit vingtième was shut down by the nazi occupiers and hergé launched the crab with the golden claws, the first of six tintin stories which he produced during the war. in the future, hergé had to move the focus of tintin’s adventures away from current affairs, in order to avoid controversy. also, the comic strip was changed to a daily three- or four frame strip instead of two complete pages every week. therefore, hergé had to introduce more frequent gags and faster paced action. hergé invented stories including an expedition to a meteorite, an intriguing mystery and treasure hunt, and a quest to undo an ancient inca curse. during and after the german occupation hergé was accused of being a collaborator because of the nazi control of the paper, and he was briefly taken in for interrogation after the war. one of the last of tintin’s adventures took place in tibet. tintin was sent to the himalayas in search of chang chong chen, the chinese boy he had befriended in the blue lotus. hergé came to regard this highly personal and emotionally tintin adventure as his favorite. hergé’s financial success allowed him to travel across europe, america, and asia in his later working period. he passed away on 3 march 1983 and left the twenty fourth tintin adventure, tintin and alph art, unfinished. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture titled “how to create characters” with an artist named jazza.\\n',\n",
       " 'marcel breuer – master of modernism.  a ski resort in france designed by marcel breuer.  on may 21, 1905, hungarian born modernist, architect and furniture designer of jewish descent marcel breuer was born. being one of the masters of modernism, breuer extended the sculptural vocabulary he had developed in the carpentry shop at the bauhaus into a personal architecture that made him one of the world’s most popular architects at the peak of 20th century design. marcel breuer (1905 – 1981) marcel breuer was one of the first students at the bauhaus arts and craft school in weimar, germany. there, his talents were detected early and he became a faculty member of the school after it had moved to dessau. breuer was first recognized by the community for his steel furniture and he managed to make his living from these designs. later on, gropius assigned him interiors at the 1927 weissenhofsiedlung and led him to his first house assignment for the harnischmachers in wiesbaden in 1932. the designer moved to london due to the rise of the nazi party in germany in the 1930s. there, he was employed by jack pritchard at the isokon company. the company was one of the earliest proponents of modern design in the united kingdom and breuer designed his long chair as well as experimented with bent and formed plywood there. his career moved on with f. r. s. yorke. breuer had designed several houses with the english modernist before accepting the invitation by gropius to follow his teacher and mentor to massachusetts. both designers created a completely new style of american housing, which was spread by their great collection of wartime students. the geller house i of 1945 is one of the first to employ breuer’s concept of the ‘binuclear’ house. it is characterized by separate wings for the bedrooms and for the living, dining, and cooking area. they are typically separated by an entry hall, and with the distinctive ‘butterfly’ roof. breuer’s first two important institutional buildings were the unesco headquarters in paris in 1955. the projects were followed by nearly 100 houses in 30 years and he went through several design phases. marcel breuer passed away in 1981 in new york city. breuer’s buildings were always distinguished by an attention to detail and a clarity of expression. he is widely considered one of the last true functionalist architects and he is believed to have shifted the bias of the bauhaus from “arts & crafts” to “arts & technology”. many pieces of modern, tubular steel furniture are still in use today, including the cesca and wassily chairs by breuer himself. they are still in production and their origins can easily be traced back to the breuer experiments of the mid 20’s. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture on ‘architecture in the early 20th century – modernism‘ by kenny mencher.\\n',\n",

       " 'beaumarchais and figaros wedding.  on may 18, 1799, french playwright pierre augustin caron de beaumarchais passed away. bonmarchais, who also was a watchmaker, inventor, musician, diplomat, fugitive, spy, publisher, horticulturalist, arms dealer, satirist, financier, and revolutionary (both french and american), is best known for his theatrical works, most notably the three figaro plays.   born in the rue saint denis, paris on 24 january 1732 as a provincial watchmakers son, beaumarchais rose in french society and became influential in the court of louis xv as an inventor and music teacher. at the time, pocket watches were commonly unreliable for timekeeping and were worn more as fashion accessories. in response to this, young beaumarchais spent nearly a year researching improvements. in july 1753, at the age of twenty one, he invented an escapement for watches that allowed them to be made substantially more accurate and compact. one of his greatest feats was a watch mounted on a ring, made for madame de pompadour, a mistress of louis xv. the invention was later recognised by the academy of sciences, but only after a dispute with lepaute, the royal watchmaker, who attempted to pass off the invention as his own. the affair first brought beaumarchais to national attention and introduced him to the royal court at versailles.   in 1756, at age 24, beaumarchais married a rich widow who died a year later. he found himself with a fortune -- the first of several he made and then lost. musically talented, he became harp teacher to the daughters of louis xv in 1759. in 1764 he made a journey to spain to protect or vindicate his sister, who had been abandoned by her betrothed, clavigo. his account of this mission in his mémoires suggested the drama clavigo to goethe. he brought from madrid a knowledge of things spanish that was later of much use to him. he now turned to the drama, wrote eugénie (1767), a fairly successful domestic drama, and les deux amis, a decided failure in the pathetic vein. meantime he had become engaged in financial speculations that led to lawsuits, and these to a series of mémoires, appeals to the public that are among the most vigorous, audacious, clever, and witty polemics in literature. their attack on judicial injustice gave them a universal interest. they were eagerly read and deepened the discontent with the existing state of society that was to culminate in the french revolution.   beaumarchais thus became a political personality. in 1776, after the remnants of george washingtons american army had crossed the delaware into pennsylvania in 1776, and british troops prepared to seize the rebel capital of philadelphia, beaumarchais wrote to french foreign minister vergennes: \"the americans will triump, but they must be assisted in their struggle. we must . . . send secret assistance in a prudent manner to the americans.\" france joined the american war of independence against britain officially in 1778, but beaumarchais had already supplied arms to the american colonies. beaumarchais was confidentially employed by louis xv and later by louis xvi; but before this he had snatched a sensational dramatic triumph out of failure by rearranging a comic opera into a five act comedy his barbier de séville (1775), spanish in scene, but essentially french at the heart; the most famous comedy of the century, save only its sequel from the same hand.   the barber of seville and the marriage of figaro showed beaumarchais sympathy for the lot of the under privileged people and the lower classes. in both plays the hero is a valet, figaro, who is more clever than his noble employers, especially his master almavira. in these class conscious plays beaumarchais mocked aristocracy although he was well aware of his dependance on its favour. this also created a constant tension in his dramas – much is said and much is written between the lines. mozarts opera version of the play was based on the libretto written by lorenzo da ponte. it gained a huge popularity. \"here they talk about nothing but figaro. nothing is played, sung or whistled but figaro,\" wrote mozart to a friend from prague. by his writings, beaumarchais contributed greatly, though quite unconsciously, to hurry on the events that led to the french revolution. when the french revolution broke out, beaumarchais was no longer the idol he had been a few years before. he was financially successful, mainly from supplying drinking water to paris, and had acquired ranks in the french nobility.   nevertheless, beaumarchais pledged his services to the new republic. he attempted to purchase 60000 rifles for the french revolutionary army from holland, but was unable to complete the deal. while he was out of the country, beaumarchais was declared an émigré (a loyalist of the old regime) by his enemies. he spent two and a half years in exile, mostly in germany, before his name was removed from the list of proscribed émigrés. he returned to paris in 1796, where he lived out the remainder of his life in relative peace.   although we dont have anything directly related with beaumarchais, at yovisto you can listen to a lively introduction into mozarts magic flute opera from san diego opera talk.\\n',\n",
       " 'the myserious voynich manuscript.  a page from the mysterious voynich manuscript in 1912, polish born antiquarian and bibliophile wilfrid voynich bought a mysterious illustrated codex hand written in an unknown writing system that may have been composed in northern italy during the italian renaissance. the eponymous voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, but no one has yet succeeded in deciphering the text. therefore, it has become a famous case in the history of cryptography. the manuscript counts about 240 pages in total, but it is assumed that several pages are missing. the text was written from left to right and patterns similar to those of natural languages were revealed by statistical analysis. still, it was found that the manuscript’s “language” is quite unlike european languages since there are no words with fewer than two letters or more than ten and it seems to be more repetitive than typical european languages. another difficult aspect is, that the lettering resembles european alphabets of the late 14th and 15th centuries, but the words do not seem to make sense in any language. it was found out that the manuscript probably consists of six sections and except the last one, every section and even almost every page contains various illustrations. the sections were examined concerning their content and given conventional names. the so called herbal section contains at least one plant on each page, which are not unambiguously identifiable. in the astronomical section, many diagrams can be found with suns, moons, and stars. further sections are probably of biological, cosmological, and pharmaceutical purpose. it is assumed that the manuscript was created between 1404 and 1438 and the mccrone research institute in chicago found that the paints in the manuscript were of materials to be expected from that period of european history. it was also suggested that the book originally belonged to emperor rudolf ii and that at some point, athanasius kircher owned the book as well. when wilfrid voynich passed away, the manuscript was inherited by his widow and then changed the owners several times before it was donated to yale university in 1969 where it was catalogued as “ms 408“. since the day the examinations on the book started, the first hypothesis considering its author were developed. in a letter to kircher, it was suggested that the author was the franciscan friar and polymath roger bacon. however, this is not the only theory. many historians came across the name edward kelly, who was a self styled alchemist and claimed to be able to invoke angels through a shewstone and had long conversations with them. the angels’ language was called enochian, after enoch, the biblical father of methuselah. several people have suggested that kelley could have fabricated the voynich manuscript to swindle the emperor. in concerns of the book’s langages, many hypothesis came up as well. it was suggested that the text could be a constructed language, others however prefer to believe that “the basis of the script was a very primitive form of synthetic universal language” (john tiltman). another theory is called the “letter based cipher” theory. it suggest that the text contains a meaningful text in a european language, that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the voynich manuscript “alphabet” through a cipher of some sort, an algorithm that operated on individual letters. this has been the working hypothesis for most twentieth century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of nsa cryptographers. further theories suggest that the text is made of a little known natural language or that it contains a certain code to be looked up in a codebook. unfortunately of all the theories, nothing was completely proven and the mystery of the manuscript had quite a cultural impact. several books, and papers were written about the book itself and also fiction works were published. this includes russel blake’s “voynich cypher“. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture on possible interpretations of the voynich manuscript by stephen bax.\\n',\n",
       " 'the phantastic travels of adelbert von chamisso.  adelbert von chamisso (1781-1831). on january 30, 1781, german poet and naturalist of french origin adelbert von chamisso was born. some of his lyrics, ballads, and romances rank among the finest in german literature. he took part in captain kotzebue‘s russian polar expedition (1815-18) and his 1835 published account of it ranges among the classics of travel. in the same way as johann wolfgang von goethe, one of germany‘s best known poets, adelbert von chamisso was as well a scientist as an author and artist. today unfortunately, almost all germans might have heart of goethe, but only a few are familiar with chamisso. on the other hand, chamisso has his own island: chamisso island, a small island in kotzebue sound, alaska. while goethe‘s travels only led him to italy once in a lifetime or to some bohemian spas for health treatments, chamisso as a botanist, travelled to the other side of the world collecting specimens. and as far as i know, goethe has never written a science fiction story like chamisso‘s ‘peter schlemihl‘s miraculous story‘. adelbert von chamisso was born as louis charles adélaïde de chamissot at ante, in champagne, france. driven out by the french revolution, his parents settled in berlin, where in 1796 young chamisso obtained the post of page in waiting to the prussian queen, and in 1798 entered a prussian infantry regiment as ensign. he had little education, and while in the prussian military service in berlin assiduously studied natural science for three years. in 1803, incollaboration with varnhagen von ense, he founded the berliner musenalmanach, in which his first verses appeared. unfortunately, this enterprise was a failure, and, interrupted by the war, it came to an end in 1806. however, it brought him to the notice of many of the literary celebrities of the day and established his reputation as a rising poet. shortly thereafter, upon the peace of tilsit in 1807 signed by napoleon bonaparte and russian tsar alexander i, chamisso‘s family was permitted to return to france. nevertheless, young chamisso remained in germany and continued his military career. he had become lieutenant in 1801, and in 1805 accompanied his regiment to hameln, where he shared in the humiliation of its treasonable capitulation in the following year. placed on parole, he went to france, but both his parents were dead. in 1808 returning to berlin he obtained his release from the service. homeless and without a profession, he lived in berlin until 1810, when, by intermediation of an old friend of the family, chamisso was offered a professorship at the lycée at napoléonville in the vendée. on his way to france, he joined the intellectual circle of madame de staël, one of napoleon‘s principal opponents, and followed her in her exile in switzerland, where he devoted himself to botanical research. illustration of peter schlemihl, who sold his shadow to the devil after his return to berlin, he published his famous narrative ‘peter schlemihl’s miraculous story‘, about a man who sold his shadow to the devil for a bottomless wallet, which has been translated into most european languages. the story, intended for children, was widely read and the character became a common cultural reference in many countries. people generally remembered the element of the shadow better than how the story ended, simplifying chamisso‘s lesson to the idiom “don’t sell your shadow to the devil.” in 1815, chamisso was appointed botanist to the russian ship rurik, which otto von kotzebue commanded on a scientific voyage round the world. his diary of the expedition (tagebuch, 1821) is a fascinating account of the expedition to the pacific ocean and the bering sea. during this trip chamisso described a number of new species found in what is now the san francisco bay area. several of these, including the california poppy, eschscholzia californica, were named after his friend johann friedrich von eschscholtz, the rurik’s entomologist. in return, eschscholtz named a variety of plants, including the genus camissonia, after chamisso.   on his return in 1818 he was made custodian of the botanical gardens in berlin, and was elected a member of the academy of sciences. in 1827, he published views and remarks on a voyage of discovery, and description of a voyage round the world. chamisso‘s travels and scientific researches restrained for a while the full development of his poetical talent, and it was not until 1829 that he turned back to literature. in collaboration with gustav schwab, and franz von gaudy, he brought out the deutscher musenalmanach, in which his later poems were mainly published. as a poet chamisso‘s reputation stands high. frauenliebe und -leben (1830), a cycle of lyrical poems set to music by robert schumann, by carl loewe, and by franz paul lachner, is particularly famous. he died in berlin at the age of 57. at

       " 'francis baily and the baily beads.  francis baily (1774-1844). on may 15, 1836, english astronomer francis baily for the first time observed the so called ‘baily’s beads‘ during an eclipse of the sun. for sure you know the effect, although you might not have seen it with your own eyes in nature. but, numerous photographs, pictures, and videos have been published, where the phenomenon can be watched. so what are beailey’s beads? the baily’s beads effect is a feature of total solar eclipses. as the moon “grazes” by the sun during a solar eclipse, the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some places, and not in others. lunar topography has considerable relief because of the presence of mountains, craters, valleys and other topographical features. the irregularities of the lunar limb profile are known accurately from observations of grazing occultations of stars. astronomers thus have a fairly good idea which mountains and valleys will cause the beads to appear in advance of the eclipse. while baily’s beads are seen briefly for a few seconds at the center of the eclipse path, their duration is maximized near the edges of the path of the umbra, reaching 1–2 minutes. the most spectacular version is the diamond ring effect that is seen when only one bead is left; a shining diamond set in a bright ring around the lunar silhouette. the name of the phenomenon is in honor of francis baily who first provided an exact explanation of the phenomenon in 1836. born 28th april 1774 in newbury, berkshire, the son of richard baily, a banker, francis started a mercantile apprenticeship at the age of fourteen. after a tour in the unsettled parts of north america in 1796–1797 – his journal of his american adventures was posthumously edited and published by mathematician augustus de morgan in 1856, baily entered the london stock exchange in 1799. as a financial expert he was very successful and also published several important works on various aspects of the financial world, such as tables for the purchasing and renewing of leases (1802), or the doctrine of interest and annuities (1808). he succeeded in earning a fortune through diligence and integrity and retired from business in 1825, to devote himself wholly to his most favourite hobby: astronomy. actually, baily was a founding member of the royal astronomical society in 1820, serving as its first secretary. “baily beads” at the solar eclipse from 1999 in 1827, baily received the gold medal of the royal astronomical society for his preparation of the society’s catalogue of 2881 stars. later, he even was elected as president of the society for four consecutive two year terms prior to his death. baily seemed to have been possessed with exactness and preciseness. thus, he was outraged by the inaccuracies in the nautical almanac, the tables seamen used to determine longitude by the moon distance method so he edited and correct them for the board of longitude. editing such tables is rather tedious work, but baily even went one step further. while working on the nautical almanac he complained that there was no star catalogue available that met the standards of accuracy necessary for his work so he set out to correct the problem. over the following years baily edited, corrected and published the star catalogues of ptolemaeus, ulugh beg, tycho brahe, halley, flamsteed, hevelius, mayer, lacaille, and d’agelet and lalande. no wonder that he was rewarded the academy’s gold medal again in 1843. baily’s observations of “baily’s beads”, during an annular eclipse of the sun on 15 may 1836, at inch bonney in roxburghshire, started the modern series of eclipse expeditions. his description of the phenomenon was so vivid as to attract an unprecedented amount of attention to the total eclipse of 8 july 1842, observed by baily himself at pavia. baily died in london on 30 august 1844 and of course there is a crater on the moon named after the most laborious astronomer. at yovisto you can learn more about solar eclipses in the presentation of prof. peter cole about the 1919 solar eclipse expedition where eddington was able to give a proof for einstein’s theory of general relativity.\\n',\n",
       " 'the airplanes of claude dornier.  claude dornier in front of the do k 3 image: german federal archive.  on may 14, 1884, german airplane builder and entrepreneur claudius dornier was born. his legacy remains in the few aircraft named after him, including the dornier do 18 and the 12-engine dornier do x flying boat, for decades the world’s largest and most powerful airplane. dornier studied engineering at the technical university of munich and began his career in karlsruhe in 1907. unfortunately, his father fell very ill and could not take care of his wine shop anymore. dornier now had to finance his entire family and take care of his father’s business. in 1910, he was hired by luftschiffbau zeppelin gmbh and he attracted attention through his brilliance in engineering, his innovative mind and economic success. he invented the rotatable zeppelin hangar and made significant contributions to the construction process of zeppelins. with the significant advancements of french engineers building aircraft heavier than air, dornier’s interest in the topic increased as well. count ferdinand zeppelin decided to go in two different directions. on the one hand he wanted to build very large aircraft and on the other hand he told dornier to construct a flying boat. along with his team of engineers, dornier moved into a newly built hangar outside friedrichshafen, where they built the flying boats rs i – iv. in 1917, the engineer managed to transform his department into an independent company of the zeppelin group. after the war, dornier began building a six passenger aircraft as well and performed the very successful maiden flights in june, 1919. dornier’s problems came up, when the general construction of military aircraft was prohibited in germany. fortunately, three of dornier’s passenger aircraft remained and were built, but in 1920 any aircraft construction was banned. dornier got creative and rented a small shed in rohrschach, switzerland, where he continued making more aircraft parts. working from home with his team, they managed to improve his gs i plane model, which was the foundation for the famous do x flying boat that was developed in the later 1920s. however, with the starting economic crisis in fall 1929, the aircraft industry decreased dramatically. the economy of the aircraft industry started with the nomination of hermann göring as the german aeronautics commissioner. when hitler came into power, the german air force was immediately expanded and dornier had just finished the development of the do f, an airplane that was described as a cargo plane but was really a bomber. after several changes, the bomber do 13 was produced starting in 1933.  in the following years, dornier also made profit from international deals with the do 24, another flying boat for maritime patrol, search and rescue. but next to military projects, the engineer also devoted much of his life time to improving his flying boat models in order to cross the atlantic ocean and designed the do 214. however, germany got ready for war and projects like these were no longer allowed. the parts of the plane that were already built had to be destroyed and the development was completely put on ice. dornier was now appointed to build only the military planes that were ordered by the government. the engineer faced difficult times after the war as well. even though he was not seen as a threat by the allied forces, his company’s hangars and offices were destroyed or confiscated. in switzerland and spain he began to rebuild his business until he managed to return to germany in the 1950s. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video documentation on the do x, at the time the largest aircraft. it took off for its first atlantic crossing on 5 november, 1930.\\n',\n",
       " 'igor sikorsky and the helicopter.  igor sikorsky in his vs 300 helicopter.  on may 13, 1940, russian american aviation pioneer igor ivanovitsch sikorsky made the maidenflight with his newly developed helicopter vs 300, which led to the r 4, the world’s first mass produced helicopter in 1942. sure we all know helicopters today. they have become an everyday object, although not everybody of us already had the chance to fly with a helicopter. actually, i had the pleasure to fly as helicopter passenger during my time of service in the airforce. i really enjoyed flying on a low profile following the terrain, being also able to look down through the glass that was part of the bottom of the aircraft. the principle of a helicopter is that its wings are not fixed as for a plane. instead the wings move (rotate) and create a lift. thus, the helicopter is able to fly also vertically. the principle behind a helicopter actually is rather old. the earliest references for vertical flight have come from china. since around 400 bc, chinese children have played with bamboo flying toys. this bamboo copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. the spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. it was not until the early 1480s, when leonardo da vinci created a design for a machine that could be described as an “aerial screw”, that any recorded advancement was made towards vertical flight. his notes suggested that he built small flying models, but there were no indications for any provision to stop the rotor from making the craft rotate. in 1861, the word “helicopter” was coined by gustave de ponton d’amécourt, a french inventor who demonstrated a small, steam powered model. while celebrated as an innovative use of a new metal, aluminum, the model never lifted off the ground. in 1906, two french brothers, jacques and louis breguet, began experimenting with airfoils for helicopters. in 1907, those experiments resulted in the gyroplane no.1. although there is some uncertainty about the dates, sometime between 14 august and 29 september 1907, the gyroplane no. 1 lifted its pilot into the air about two feet (0.6 m) for a minute. the gyroplane no. 1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. helicopters were developed and built during the first half century of flight, with the focke wulf fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936. the fw 61 broke all of the helicopter world records in 1937, and nazi germany used helicopters in small numbers during world war ii for observation, transport, and medical evacuation. but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by russian born engineer igor sikorsky reached full scale production, with 131 aircraft built. by the time igor sikorsky competed with lawrence lepageto to produce the  military’s first helicopter. lepage received the patent rights to develop helicopters patterned after the fw 61, and built the xr 1, an early american twin rotor helicopter, winner of a united states army air corps design competition held in early 1940. but, the flight testing of the xr 1 proved troublesome. meanwhile, sikorsky settled on a simpler, single rotor design, the vs 300, which turned out to be the first practical single lifting rotor helicopter design. after experimenting with configurations to counteract the torque produced by the single main rotor, sikorsky settled on a single, smaller rotor mounted on the tailboom. the cyclic control was found to be difficult to perfect, and led to sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tail boom. by varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. in this setup, it was found that the vs 300 couldn’t fly forward easily and sikorsky joked about turning the pilot’s seat around. sikorsky fitted utility floats (also called pontoons) to the vs 300 and performed a water landing and takeoff on 17 april 1941, making it the first practical amphibious helicopter. developed from the vs 300, sikorsky’s r 4 was the first large scale mass produced helicopter, with a production order for 100 aircraft. the r 4 was the only allied helicopter to serve in world war ii, when it was used primarily for rescue in burma, alaska, and other areas with harsh terrain. total production reached 131 helicopters before the r 4 was replaced by other sikorsky helicopters such as the r 5 and the r 6. in all, sikorsky produced over 400 helicopters before the end of world war ii. at yovisto you can learn more about the history of early helicopters in a short documentary produced for encyclopedia britannica, now part of the prellinger archive on helicopters from 1953.\\n',\n",
       " 'florence nightingale – the lady with the lamp.  a hospital at scutari where nightingale worked 1856.  on may 12, 1820, celebrated british social reformer and statistician florence nightingale was born. she is best known for being the founder of modern nursing. she came to prominence while serving as a nurse during the crimean war, where she tended to wounded soldiers. she was known as “the lady with the lamp” after her habit of making rounds at night. it is known that florence nightingale was a very well educated young woman and she realized the lack of opportunity for females in her social circle quite early. it is assumed that she had a very good relationship with her father, who was involved in anti slavery movements. he was known to have respected his daughter as a friend and companion and supported her education highly. florence started to visit people living in poverty and her interest in helping ill people increased highly in her early years. florence often came to london to investigate possible occupations for women in the city’s hospitals. unfortunately, nurses were not very much respected, since the occupation did not require a decent education at that time. her visits became more frequent around 1844, but in this period, she also took time to travel to egypt and paris and she managed to get an introduction to a convent at alexandria. she noticed that the disciplined and well organised sisters made better nurses than women in england. following these events, florence nightingale attended the institute of protestant deaconesses at kaiserswerth, a training school for women teachers and nurses. florence nightingale (1820 – 1910) a major milestone in florence nightingale’s life was the beginning of the crimean war in 1854. it was reported that sick and heavily wounded people suffered in english camps and in the media it was pointed out how different the conditions for wounded soldiers in french camps were. a shout out to all women in england was made to help the people of their country in need. nightingale decided to go to the crimea approximately in october of the same year and embarked with over thirty other nurses, reaching scutari during the eve of the battle of inkerman. nightingale functioned as superintendent of the female nurses in the hospitals in the east, but everyone just called her the lady in chief. the headquarters for the newly arrived nurses was the barrack hospital at scutari. the place was described as incredibly filthy and nightingale explained that there was no water, soap, clothes or enough food when she arrived. the soldiers just laid there in their uniforms, spreading the infectious diseases. next to the lack of sufficient supplies, the nurses also had to face the offensive behavior of the orderlies. fortunately, nightingale and her crew managed to improve the situation at the hospital. more and more support, supplies and food were sent and nightingale established a vast kitchen and a laundry. next to the full time job at the hospital, nightingale also took time to take care of the soldiers’ families and made rounds, watching the wounded soldiers at night since she was the only nurse allowed in the wards. the men started calling her the lady with the lamp. henry wadsworth longfellow then popularized the phrase with his poem santa filomena (extract): lo! in that house of misery a lady with a lamp i see pass through the glimmering gloom, and flit from room to room. with all the ill people in the hospital and the bad working condition for the doctors and nurses, many of them got sick or even passed away themselves. also, the frost bite and dysentery from exposure in the trenches before sevastopol made the wards fuller than before and the death rate increased to 42% by february 1855. nightingale was not immune to the infectious diseases as well. when she visited balaclava, she fell ill with the so called crimean fever, but fortunately recovered and resumed her work in scutari later on. in 1856, florence nightingale returned home and entered england without anyone noticing. she got the chance to meet queen victoria and prince albert, telling them about the miserable situation and then, a fund had been set up to found a training school for nurses. the nightingale school and home for nurses was established at st. thomas’s hospital and she watched the progress of the new institution with practical interest even though she was asked to be its superintendent. her health began to decline so she preferred to settle in london and retire from her busy work life. in this period, she published several works and reports on the army medical departments in the crimea. in the following years, the first military hospital was established and an army medical college was opened at chatham. nightingale immediately offered to leave for india when the indian mutiny broke out in 1857. even though her services were not required, she became interested in the sanitary condition of the army and people there. from her work, a sanitary department was established in the indian government. she became familiar with many facets of indian life and demanded that there should be improvements in health and sanitation there. florence nightingale passed away on 13 august 1910. at yovisto, you may be interested in a historical video lecture by barbara dossey on florence nightingale at the university of alabama.\\n',\n",
       " 'the very first printed book.  the frontispiece of the diamond sutra from tang dynasty china, the world’s earliest dated printed book, ad 868 (british museum) on may 11, 868, the earliest dated printed book was issued, a chinese copy of the so called diamond sutra, one of the most important textbooks of buddhism, originally written in the 1st c. ad. you might think the it was johannes gutenberg who invented modern printing. but, he didn’t. sure, printing with metal movable types including a printing press and a suitable ink, but mostover a way to produce movable types in sufficient quality and sufficient number with few effort, this was gutenberg’s most notable invention. printing itself existed long before gutenberg. especially, if you think of woodcuts or so called woodblock printing. the earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from china and are of silk printed with flowers in three colors from the han dynasty (before ad 220 ). it is clear that woodblock printing developed in asia several centuries before europe. the chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper (woodcuts). it is also now established that the use in europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block books only came after the development of movable type in the 1450s. because chinese has a character set running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than movable type to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. although the chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in korea in the 13th century, woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting chinese text with its 40000 or more characters. the oldest existing print done with wood blocks is the mugujeonggwang great dharani sutra that is dated between ad 704 and 751. it was found at bulguksa, south korea in 1966. but, the print we focus today is a wood block printed copy in the british library which, although not the earliest example of block printing, is the earliest example which bears an actual date. the book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. the extant copy has the form of a scroll, about 5 meters long. the archaeologist sir marc aurel stein purchased it in 1907 in the walled up mogao caves near dunhuang in northwest china from a monk guarding the caves - known as the “caves of the thousand buddhas“. the colophon, at the inner end, reads: reverently made for universal free distribution by wang jie on behalf of his two parents on the 15th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of xiantong [11 may 868]. this is more than 500 years before the gutenberg bible was first printed. how did the technique come to europe and the western world? block books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in europe in the mid 15th century. as they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. the technique of woodblock printing is found through east and central asia, and in the byzantine world for cloth, and by ad 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in islamic egypt. printing onto cloth had already spread much earlier, and was common in europe by 1300. around the 13th century the chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to europe, soon after paper became available in europe. the print in woodcut, later joined by engraving, quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as playing cards. although many had believed that (european) block books preceded gutenberg’s invention of movable type in the first part of the 1450s, it now is accepted that most of the surviving block books were printed in the 1460s or later, and that the earliest surviving examples may date to about 1451. they seem to have functioned as a cheap popular alternative to the typeset book, which was still very expensive at this stage. block books continued to be printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century and were then more and more replaced by their movable type alternatives that have become less expensive. at yovisto, you can learn more about the future of books in a video conversation of dan clancy and john hollar on “books, google and the future of digital print“.\\n',\n",

       " 'mary the jewess and the origins of chemistry.  mary the prophetess (ca. 1st to 3rd century ad) mary the jewess (also known as maria prophetissima or miriam the prophetess) is a figure who first appeared in the works of the gnostic christian writer zosimos of panopolis, whose sources for this are not clear. on the basis of zosimos’s comments, she lived between the first and third centuries  she is credited with the invention of several kinds of chemical apparatus and is considered to be the first true alchemist of the western world. the very first nonfictious alchemists of the western world lived, as far as can be ascertained, in hellenistic egypt. among these also was mary the jewess for whom our chief source is zosimos of panopolis, an early alchemist and gnostic mystic from the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th century ad. he wrote the oldest known books on alchemy, of which quotations in the greek language and translations into syriac or arabic are known. unfortunately, zosimus‘ misidentified maria as ‘mirjam’ the sister of moses. nevertheless, zosimus‘ writing are our most important source for the history of alchemy in antiquity. he is one of about 40 authors represented in a compendium of alchemical writings that was probably put together in byzantium (constantinople) in the 7th or 8th century ad and that exists in manuscripts in venice and paris. zosimos provided one of the first definitions of alchemy as the study of “the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying and disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies.” “one becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the one as the fourth.” (known as the ‘axiom of maria‘) we know very little about mary and her life. zosimos only described several of mary’s experiments and instruments. in his writings, mary is almost always mentioned as having lived in the past, and she is described as “one of the sages.” george syncellus, a byzantine chronicler of the 8th century, presented mary as a teacher of the philosopher democritus, whom she had met in memphis, egypt, during the time of pericles. the famous 10th century index of arabic books kit?b al fihrist of ibn al nadim cited mary as one of the 52 most famous alchemists and stated that she was able to prepare caput mortuum, a purple pigment. the roman philosopher morieno called her “mary the prophetess,” and the arabs knew her as the “daughter of plato” — a name which, in western alchemical texts, was reserved for white sulfur. an alchemical balneum mariae although none of mary’s writings have survived, some quotations credited to her are found in hermetic writings. the most notable of these are found in the dialogue of mary and aros on the magistery of hermes, which is an extract made by an anonymous christian philosopher. there are several alchemistical apparatuses which maria either invented or which she gave a description of, according to zosimos‘ writings. the tribikos was a kind of alembic with three arms that was used to obtain substances purified by distillation. the kerotakis is a device used to heat substances used in alchemy and to collect vapors. it is an airtight container with a sheet of copper upon its upper side and thus, it is an early predecessor of today’s pressure cooker. the kerotakis was said to be a replication of the process of the formation of gold that was occurring in the bowels of the earth. mary’s name survives in her invention of the bain marie, which is extensively used in chemical processes for which a gentle heat is necessary. she also left us with several procedures, among them also the preparation of the philosopher’s stone. but, as always in alchemy, the description of procedures most times are more enigmatic than enlightening, as e.g. “invert nature and you will find that which you seek.” (from the description of the preparation of the philosopher’s stone) at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture [in german] on aspasia and diotima as part of a lecture series featuring women in philosophy.\\n',\n",
       " 'carl hagenbeck and the modern zoo.  portrait carl hagenbeck and walrus pallas 1911.  on may 7, 1907, german merchant of wild animals carl hagenbeck founded germany’s most successful privately owned zoo, the tierpark hagenbeck. he created the modern zoo with animal enclosures without bars that were closer to their natural habitat. already his father, gottfried hagenbeck, who was originally a fish dealer started displaying and trading animals in the mid 19th century. in 1866, carl hagenbeck joined his father’s business and started to expand it to one of the biggest of its kind in germany. during the early years of his business activities, hagenbeck sent only a few expeditions to africa in order to catch wild animals but soon he organized expeditions around the globe. in this period, hagenbeck discovered a completely new business model, which is today seen as extremely controversial. he opened some sort of ‘human zoo‘ in 1875. the first exhibition included a demonstration of the sami people. the spectators were able to see their “everyday life” at the exhibition area and the show became so successful, that hagenbeck soon moved on to berlin and leipzig, germany. he began displaying further groups including african families and inuits. when hagenbeck opened his modern zoo, he had more space and added more groups from various countries. until this day, hagenbeck it criticized for his ‘human zoo‘, because the exhibited people received extremely low wages and they were often confronted with false promises concerning their stay in germany. hagenbeck’s circus opened in 1887. three years later he began to perform at several exhibitions with tamed wild animals. hagenbeck also started planning his revolutionary zoo without barred cages, which he even filed a patent for. the modern zoo opened on 5 may 1907 in stellingen, north of hamburg, which still exists on this day. one of the most famous exhibitions in the famous zoo was the walrus pallas you can see in the image above. the portrait was painted in 1911 and is still displayed at the ‘hamburger kunsthalle‘, a famous art museum in the city. throughout the years, hagenbeck’s concept of the modern zoo spread and was furtherly developed. zoo directors also began making conservation a central topic and stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. the very first safari park was opened in england in 1931. visitors were able to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity to the animals. however, the concepts of zoos in general stayed a controversial topic until this day. mass destruction of wildlife habitat has yet to cease all over the world and many species are in danger of dying out. today’s zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species. many zoos see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. some critics say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, are immoral and serve nothing but fill human leisure. however, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education. talking of conservation strategies in zoos, you may be interested in a video lecture on the conservation of the spotted owl at sequoia park zoo by biologist lowell diller.\\n',\n",

       " 'you press the button and we do the rest – george eastman revolutionized photography.  george eastman (1854-1932). on may 5, 1885, george eastman filed a patent for a “roll holder for photographic films“, which was the first film in roll form to prove practicable. based on his newly invented roll film and a rather simple camera for that film, he established the eastman kodak company, in rochester, new york. it was one of the first firms to mass produce standardized photography equipment. ok, please hold on before you are writing me comments that george eastman has not invented the roll film. actually, already in 1881 a farmer in cambria, wisconsin, peter houston, invented the first roll film camera. his younger brother david, filed the patents for various components of peter’s camera. he was issued an 1881 patent for a roll film holder which he licensed to george eastman (it was used in eastman’s kodak 1888 box camera). houston sold the patent outright to eastman for $5000 in 1889. btw, roll film was also the basis for the invention of motion picture film in 1888 by the world’s first film makers eadweard muybridge and a few years later by their followers thomas edison and the lumière brothers. but, today’s post deals with george eastman. eastman was born the youngest of three children on july 12, 1854, in waterville, upstate new york to george washington eastman and maria eastman. george sr. had started a small business school, eastman commercial college, in rochester, where he moved the family in 1860. but he died suddenly when george jr. was 8. to support the family, george’s mother had to take boarders. thus, young george left school early and started working to add to the family income. he began as a messenger and office boy for insurance companies for only $3 a week and studied accounting at home to qualify for a higher salary, leading to a job as bookkeeper at the rochester savings bank. at age 24, george planned to visit santo domingo, where a boom in land speculation was underway, and, on the advice of a colleague, decided to document the trip with photographs. but the photography equipment with all the required tools of the “wet plate” era alone was enormous, heavy and costly. the camera alone was as big as a microwave oven and needed a heavy tripod. and he carried a tent so that he could spread photographic emulsion on glass plates before exposing them, and develop the exposed plates before they dried out. instead taking the trip, he began to research how to make photography less cumbersome and easier. after reading about a formula for a “dry plate” emulsion in a british magazine and with the help of two local amateur photographers – george monroe and george selden – , eastman formulated a gelatin based paper film and a device for coating dry plates. plates coated with this emulsion remained sensitive after they were dry and could be exposed at leisure. using a formula taken from one of these british journals, eastman began making gelatin emulsions. he resigned from his bank job after launching his fledgling photography company in april 1880, because he had not only invented a dry plate formula, but had patented a machine for preparing large numbers of the plates. eastman’s experiments were directed to the use of a lighter and more flexible support than glass. his first approach was to coat the photographic emulsion on paper and then load the paper in a roll holder. the holder was used in view cameras in place of the holders for glass plates. in 1884, eastman hired william hall walker, a camera inventor and manufacturer, and together they designed the eastman walker roll holder, which allowed photographers to advance paper film through a camera rather than handle individual plates. the roll holder came to define the basic technology of cameras until the introduction of digital photography in the late twentieth century. while the first kodak camera was wildly popular with amateurs, the paper film used in it gave mediocre results. henry reichenbach, a chemist hired to work on emulsions, was asked to come up with a transparent, flexible film, and he succeeded in february 1889. in 1888 eastman invented the word “kodak” as a distinctive name for a film camera he was developing. he needed a strong, short, distinctive word that would also meet foreign trademark laws, and the letter “k” was a personal favorite of eastman’s. according to him, “it became a question of trying out a great number of combinations of letters that made words starting and ending with ‘k.’ the word ‘kodak’ is the result.” but, the overall success did not only come from inventing the new type of camera alone. moreover, eastman took care of the entire lifecycle of taking photographs. thus, enabling also the pre loaded with enough film for 100 exposures, the kodak camera could easily be carried and handheld during its operation. after the film was exposed (all the shots taken), the whole camera was returned to the kodak company in rochester, new york, where the film was developed, prints were made, new photographic film was inserted, and then the camera and prints were returned to the customer. “you press the button, we do the rest” promised george eastman in 1888 with this advertising slogan for his kodak camera. eastman pioneered an employee dividend system that made his workers part owners of the firm, and he gave millions of dollars to the rochester institute of technology, university of rochester, and massachusetts institute of technology. in 1932, eastman’s health started to fade and the age of 77 he shot himself in the head, leaving a note that read simply, “to my friends: my work is done. why wait?” at yovisto you can

       " 'how the pope divided the new world among spain and the rest of the world.  the cantino planisphere of 1502 shows the line of the treaty of tordesillas. on may 4, 1493, pope alexander vi issued the papal bull ‘inter caetera‘ (among other [works]), which granted to spain all lands to the “west and south” of a pole to pole line 100 leagues west and south of any of the islands of the azores or the cape verde islands. in the late 15th century, spain and portugal had a quite difficult relationship due to their competing explorers and the wish to own as many colonial territories as possible along the african coast line. the previous years, several papal bulls were issued and the spanish government came to realize the authority of these bulls. they initiated diplomatic discussions over the rights to possess and govern the newly found lands. even though the spanish and portuguese delegates debated and negotiated for several months concerning this topic, they could not find any agreement. spain then contacted pope alexander vi, who was known to be befriended with the spanish king. they urged the pope to issue a new bull favorable to spain. alexander vi did so and issued four edicts in may 1493. the third superseded the first two, and the fourth, titled inter caetera, superseded the third. a fifth edict, dudum siquidem of 26 september 1493, supplemented the inter caetera. the inter caetera was followed by the treaty of tordesillas and together they defined and delineated a zone of spanish rights exclusive of portugal. however, the agreement was illegal in relation to other states, even though spain spent much time and effort to persuade further european leaders on the validity. at first, it was unclear whether lands to the east of the line would belong to portugal. at this point, portugal had reched africa, but not yet india. these lands were given to portugal through the aeterni regis, a bull from 1481. but, in the bull dudum siquidem, the pope granted spain the territory in the eastern waters as well. these events led to the treaty of tordesillas between spain and portugal, about one year after the bull was issued. the treaty moved the line further west to a meridian 370 leagues west of the portuguese cape verde islands, now explicitly giving portugal all newly discovered lands east of the line. the treaty also allowed the two countries to pass each other toward the west or east, and still possess whatever lands they were first to discover. an important effect of the combination of this papal bull and the treaty of tordesillas was that nearly all the pacific ocean and the west coast of north america were given to spain. in response to portugal’s discovery of the spice islands in 1512, the spanish put forward the idea, in 1518, that pope alexander had divided the world into two halves. further european states now claimed that the pope had not the right to convey sovereignty of regions as vast as the new world. on this day, numerous groups, representing indigenous people of the americas have organized protests and raised petitions seeking the repeal of the papal bull inter caetera. they claim, the bull led to the subjugation of their folks, and they want to remind catholic leaders of the record of conquest, disease and slavery in the americas. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture by emily o’brien, who talks about “the good, the bad, and the ugly: reflections on the renaissance papacy“.\\n',\n",
       " 'spam rules the internet.  on may 3, 1978, the earliest documented spam (although the term had not yet been coined) was sent as a message advertising the availability of a new model of digital equipment corporation computers sent by gary thuerk to 393 recipients on arpanet. today, spam has become a global issue that is not only restricted to email. there is spam in instant messaging, newsgroups, social networks, mobile phones, online gaming, search engines, blogs, wikis, video platforms, etc. spam is simply everywhere in the internet. spam is not only annoying, spam can also be dangerous, because can be used to spread computer viruses, trojan horses or other malicious software. have you ever wondered, where the word comes from? well here’s the story. according to the internet society and other sources, the term spam is derived from the 1970 spam sketch of the bbc television comedy series monty python’s flying circus. the sketch is set in a cafe where nearly every item on the menu includes spam canned luncheon meat. as the waiter recites the spam filled menu, a chorus of viking patrons drowns out all conversations with a song repeating “spam, spam, spam, spam… lovely spam! wonderful spam!“, hence “spamming” the dialogue. spam is a canned precooked meat product made by the hormel foods corporation, first introduced in 1937. while most people assume spam is short for “spiced ham,” only a handful of people know its true origin. the name was actually suggested in naming contest by ken daigneau, a hormel vp’s brother, before the product was introduced in 1937. daigneau won a naming contest and $100. other theories include “special processed american meat” and “shoulders of pork and ham.” according to brad templeton, founder of clarinet communication corporation, the first business on the internet, the first email spam was sent out to all users on arpanet, which had only several hundreds of users by the time. it was an ad for a presentation by digital equipment corporation sent out by gary thuerk. rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, carl gartley, write a single mass e mail. reaction from the net community was fiercely negative, but the spam did generate some sales – and a new business method was born. it was not until 1993 that a usenet posting was called “spam.” in an attempt to implement a retro moderation system that allowed posts to be deleted after they had been posted, richard depew accidentally created a monster. his software, armm, had a bug in it which caused it to post 200 messages to the newsgroup news.admin.policy. readers of this group were making jokes about the accident, one person referring to the incident as “spamming.” thus, spam received its name. the first major commercial spam incident started on march 5, 1994, when a husband and wife team of lawyers, laurence canter and martha siegel, began using bulk usenet posting to advertise immigration law services. the incident was commonly termed the “green card spam“, after the subject line of the postings. defiant in the face of widespread condemnation, the attorneys claimed their detractors were hypocrites and a that they had a free speech right to send unwanted commercial messages. spam continues simply because it seems to work. according to a commtouch report in the first quarter of 2010, there are 183 billion spam messages sent every day. more than 97% of all emails sent over the net are unwanted, according to a microsoft security report. the most popular spam topic is “pharmacy ads” which make up 81% of email spam messages, followed by replicas, enhancers, phishing emails, university degrees, and online casinos. advance fee fraud spam such as the “nigerian connection” may be sent by a single individual from a cyber cafe in a developing country. organized “spam gangs” operate from sites set up by the russian mafia, including turf battles and revenge killings. spam is also a medium for fraudsters to scam users into entering personal information on fake web sites using emails forged to look like they are from banks or other organizations, such as paypal. this is known as phishing. targeted phishing, where known information about the recipient is used to create forged emails, is known as spear phishing. spamming is illegal. sending spam violates the acceptable use policy (aup) of almost all internet service providers. all the countries of the european union have passed laws that specifically target spam. today, every user can take measures against spam by setting up a spam filter. today’s spam filters are often based on probabilistic techniques such as naive bayes filtering. bayesian filters rely on word probabilities. if a message contains many words that are used only in spam, and few that are never used in spam, it is likely to be spam. but, it has become a rat race. spam provider are constantly weakening bayesian filters by include lines of irrelevant, random words in their spam messages, a technique known as bayesian poisoning. thus, despite having switched on a spam filter that learns with every email i mark as spam, more than 50% of my daily email messages are still spam. sometimes, i am afraid, where this will end… at yovisto, you can learn more about spam detection in a google tech talk: “witch – a new approach for spam detection‘.\\n',\n",

       " 'orson welles’ citizen kane.  citizen kane – theatrical release poster.  on may 1st, 1941, orson welles famous movie ‘citizen kane‘ premiered at rko’s flagship theatre, radio city music hall. the film was directed, co written, produced by, and starring orson welles. it was nominated for academy awards in nine categories and won an academy award for best writing (original screenplay) by herman mankiewicz and welles. citizen kane often is considered by critics, filmmakers and fans to be the greatest film ever made. “rosebud…” (opening line; his last word as charles foster kane dies.) welles’s notoriety following the war of the worlds broadcast earned him hollywood’s interest, and rko offered him a rather unusual contract in 1939. the studio’s offer was to produce, direct, write, and act in two feature films, where the studio only had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500000. welles, only 25 years of age, was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the privilege of final cut – unheard of at the time for a first time director. there is dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use william randolph hearst as the basis for charles foster kane. welles claimed it was his idea while others claim that it was the idea of screenwriter herman j. mankiewicz. mankiewicz had frequented hearst’s parties until his alcoholism got him barred. hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within hollywood, so welles had mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. welles‘ and mankiewicz’s work at the studio with their new script evolved smoothly and scene after scene were shot on the set with a unique spontaneity. many things have been said about the techniques, the groundbreaking methods and the special effects they used. they didn’t break every ground in techniques, many things they used had actually been achieved before, but they certainly refined it together and managed some amazing effects. the work of photographer gregg toland’s was especially instrumental for the film, unquestionable so, also welles’s visual journey through the years of charles foster kane, the aging masks used in his face, was something brand new in make up art. they even hacked out floors to sink cameras deep down under floor level to get an extremely low angle, the way they showed ceilings, the way they worked with lights and shadows. in the end, welles and his crew were in the process of seeking new inventive forms of how to make movies and they set completely new standards to cinematography. among the most impressive techniques applied by welles are the use of a subjective camera as well as unconventional lighting, including chiaroscuro, backlighting and high contrast lighting, prefiguring the darkness and low key lighting of future film noirs. moreover there was the inventive use of shadows and strange camera angles, following in the tradition of german expressionists in the style of  murnau. but what is most striking are the deep focus shots with incredible depth of field and focus from extreme foreground to extreme background. but, let’s have a look at the plot. newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst, who lived at san simeon in california, clearly influenced charles foster kane’s character. this becomes obvious when we’re going through the film and follow kane around as a journalist, as as a politician, as owner of the pleasure ground xanadu. citizen kane tells the story of charles foster kane whose arrogance had alienated him from everyone who loved him, and who had died alone inside the vast gothic pile of his lonely castle in florida. the complex and pessimistic theme of a spiritually failed man is told from several, unreliable perspectives and points of view by several different characters – the associates and friends of the deceased – providing a sometimes contradictory, non sequential, and enigmatic portrait. its the thought provoking, tragic epic story of a ‘rags to riches’ child who inherited a fortune, taken away from his poor family and being raised by a banker, becoming a fabulously wealthy, arrogant, and energetic newspaperman. after two failed marriages and a transformation into a morose, grotesque, and tyrannical monster, his final days were spent alone and unhappy before his death in a reclusive refuge. throughout the film the discovery and revelation of the mystery of the life of charles foster kane is determined through a reporter’s search for the meaning of his single, cryptic dying word: “rosebud“. citizen kane never did get a proper national release. it could not play in major theaters in many cities, because they were block booked by the big studios, which boycotted the film. of course it could not be advertised in the influential hearst papers. and although the film was instantly hailed by many critics, it won only one academy award – which welles shared with herman j. mankiewicz, for the screenplay, although it as originally nominated for nine awards. in a 1941 review, jorge luis borges called citizen kane a metaphysical detective story, in that subject (both

       " 'j. j. thompson and the electron.  j. j. thomson (1856 – 1940).  on april 30, 1897, english physicist joseph john thomson gives the first experimental proof of the electron, which had been already theoretically predicted by johnstone stoney. thomson was awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physics for the discovery of the electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. joseph john thompson was born in 1856 in manchester, england and was taught mainly in private schools at the beginning. in 1876, he enrolled at trinity college, cambridge where he received his bachelor’s and master’s degree. when thompson became cavendish professor of physics, ernest rutherford was among his students and later on, he succeeded thompson in the post. thompson was known to be an excellent teacher. seven of his research assistants and his son were able to win the nobel prizes in physics. thompson himself was awarded the famous prize in 1906 “in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.” two years later, he was knighted. in 1918, thompson became master of the trinity college in cambridge. the fact that atoms were built up from a more fundamental unit was already suggested by scientists like william prout or norman lockyer. however, j. j. thompson was the first known scientist to suggest that the fundamental unit was over 1000 times smaller than an atom. today, the subatomic particle is known as the electron. to achieve this discovery, thompson used his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. he published his suggestion on 30 april 1897 following his discovery that lenard rays could travel much further through air than expected for an atom sized particle. at first, he estimated the mass of cathode rays through the heat that was generated when the rays hit a thermal junction. then thompson compared his result with the magnetic deflection of the rays. as a result, thompson could suggest that cathode rays were more than 100 times lighter than the hydrogen atom and also, he concluded that their mass was the same in whichever type of atom they came from. he then concluded that the rays were composed of light and negatively charged particles, a universal building block of atoms. thompson named the particles “corpuscles”, but scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by george johnstone stoney prior to thompson’s discovery. one month after thompson’s important announcement of the corpuscle he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. by comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass to charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. this became the classic means of measuring the charge and mass of the electron. thomson believed that the corpuscles emerged from the atoms of the trace gas inside his cathode ray tubes. he concluded that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. to explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge. his model became widely known as the “plum pudding” model of atoms. ernest rutherford disproved this model later on with his famous gold foil experiment, which led to the discovery of the nucleus. j. j. thomson’s cathode ray tube with electromagnetic deflection coils next to this famous discovery, thompson and his research assistant f. w. aston channeled a stream of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field. they measured its deflection and observed two patches of light on the photographic plate, which was placed in the path. they concluded, that neon is composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (isotopes), which was the first evidence for isotopes of a stable element. also, thompson’s separation of neon isotopes by their mass was the first example of mass spectrometry. in 1905, thomson discovered the natural radioactivity of potassium and one year later he managed to demonstrate that hydrogen had only a single electron per atom. at yovisto, you may be interested in a very easily to understand lecture on the discovery of the electron by tyler dewitt.\\n',\n",
       " 'henri poincaré – the last universalist of mathematics.  henri poincaré (1854 – 1912).  on april 29, 1854, french mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and a philosopher of science henri poincaré was born. he is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as the last universalist since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime. jules henri poincaré was born near france and excelled in every class from the very beginning. it is assumed that his mother had a conversation with his teacher, when he was about 13 years old. the teacher told her that “henri will become a mathematician … i would say a great mathematician“. however, when poincare graduated in 1871 and only received the grade ‘fair’ in science. in mathematics, poincare received zero points, it is assumed that he answered the wrong questions. two years later, poincare enrolled at the école polytechnique and again, he excelled in every subject, but graduated only as the second in class due to his inability to draw. poincare submitted a dissertation on partial differential equations and he was then put in charge of the course on differential and integral calculus at the university of caen. in 1880, the mathematician made use of non euclidean geometry for the first time and resolved a problem in the theory of differential equations to the competition for the grand prize in mathematics of the academy of sciences in paris. he was put on the faculty of sciences at the university of paris and later on, he succeeded g. lippmann in the chair of mathematical physics and probability. poincare switched institutes and universities a lot in the next years, and in 1904, he became professor of general astronomy at the école polytechnique. poincare managed to make significant contributions to classical mechanics and even more important, he was able to publish a founding document in chaos theory. poincare showed that general, the stability of n body systems (like the solar system) cannot be demonstrated. in this context, he also proved his recurrence theorem. when working on the foundations of topology, poincare became increasingly interested in what topological properties characterized a sphere. in 1900, he claimed that homology was sufficient to tell if a 3-manifold was a 3-sphere and four years later, he described a counterexample to this claim, a space now called the poincaré homology sphere. the poincaré sphere was the first example of a homology sphere poincare now had to establish that the poincaré sphere was different from the 3-sphere and he introduced a new topological invariant, the fundamental group. he was able to show, that the poincaré sphere had a fundamental group of order 120, while the 3-sphere had a trivial fundamental group. in this way he was able to conclude that these two spaces were, indeed, different. pointcare also wondered whether a 3-manifold with the homology of a 3-sphere and also trivial fundamental group had to be a 3-sphere. in november 2002, russian mathematician grigori perelman published his outline of a solution of the poincaré conjecture and four years later perelman was awarded, but declined, the fields medal for his proof. in 2010, the clay mathematics institute awarded perelman the $1 million millennium prize in recognition of his proof, which he rejected as well. poincaré became the president of the french academy in 1906 and was elected to the académie française in 1908. during his lifetime, henri poincaré published over five hundred scientific papers and over thirty books. he passed away on july 17, 1912 in paris. at yovisto, you may be interested in an entertaining video explaining the poincare conjecture and its importance for science.\\n',\n",

       " 'john james audubon’s birds of america.  carolina parakeet amidst a leafy branch by john james audubon.  on april 26, 1785, french american ornithologist, naturalist, and painter john james audubon was born. he was notable for his expansive studies to document all types of american birds and for his detailed illustrations that depicted the birds in their natural habitats. his major work, a color plate book entitled the birds of america (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. ok, who the heck is john james audubon and why should i care? this is what you may possibly think, if you haven’t heart of him. now, this is going to change. on december 6, 2010, a copy of the birds of america was sold at a sotheby’s auction for $11.5 million, the second highest price for a single printed book. this should give you some hint, that james audubon’s work must have been considered something special. therefore, let’s take a look at the life of this famous ornithologist and painter, especially on his best known major work of art, “the birds of america“. jean jacques audubon was born in 1785 in les cayes in the french colony of saint domingue (now haiti) as illegitimate son on his father’s sugar plantation, lieutenant jean audubon, a french naval officer from the south of brittany. his mother died when the boy was a few months old. during the american revolution, lieutenant jean audubon had been imprisoned by the british empire and after his release helped the american cause. rising unrest in saint domingue from african slaves, who greatly outnumbered french colonists, convinced jean audubon to return to france, where he succeeded to regularize the legal status of his children. in france during the chaotic years of the french revolution and its aftermath, the younger audubon grew up to be a handsome man. raised by his stepmother, mrs. audubon, in nantes, france, jean jacques took a lively interest in birds, nature, drawing, and music. from his earliest days, audubon had an affinity for birds and was encouraged by his father on his interest in nature. he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds’ eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings.at age 12, audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. he quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation, and soon ended his naval career. at age 18, jean jacques audubon boarded ship for immigration to the united states in 1803 to avoid conscription in the napoleonic wars. adopting the americanized name john james, audubon adapted to america and lived as a country gentleman, on the family owned estate at mill grove, near philadelphia, hunting, fishing, and indulging in his passion for observing and drawing birds. while there, he met his wife, lucy bakewell and conducted the first known bird banding experiment in north america, tying strings around the legs of eastern phoebes; he learned that the birds returned to the very same nesting sites each year. audubon tried his luck at various endeavors in ohio and kentucky, and discovered that he was not suited for a life of business. audubon set off on his epic quest to depict america’s birdlife, with nothing but his gun, artist’s materials, and a young assistant. floating down the mississippi towards new orleans, he lived a rugged hand to mouth existence in the south while lucy earned money as a tutor to wealthy plantation families. thus, audubon was able to devote himself to what he saw as his true calling, the painting of birds, while his wife managed to support the family. after failing to interest any american publishers in his ambitious plan to publish a book of paintings of american birds in 1826, audubon sailed with his partly finished collection to england and became literally an overnight success. highly regarded in british society as a natural unschooled genius. with his long hair and rough american clothes, he became something of a celebrity. his life size, highly dramatic bird portraits, along with his embellished descriptions of wilderness life, hit just the right note at the height of the continent’s romantic era. audubon found a printer for the birds of america, first in edinburgh, then london. to produce the book, audubon’s images were etched on copper plates, and the resulting printed sheets were colored by artists to match audubon’s original paintings. eventually the book was sold to 161 subscribers, who paid the immense sum of $1000 for what became four volumes. in total, birds of america contained 435 pages featuring more than 1000 individual paintings of birds. with the success of birds of america, audubon purchased a 14-acre estate along the hudson river north of new york city. in 1843 audubon set off on his last great expedition, visiting the western territories of the united states so he could paint american mammals. he traveled from st. louis to the dakota territory in the company of buffalo hunters, and wrote a book which became known as the missouri journal. john james audubon was not the first person to attempt to paint and describe all the birds of america, but for half a century he was the young country’s dominant wildlife artist. his seminal birds of america, a collection of 435 life size prints, has become a standard in ornithology. today, the name audubon remains synonymous with birds and bird conservation the world over. at yovisto, you can take a short look at an original exemplar of john james audubon’s birds of america in a video presentation of the 1888 edition by jacob studer.\\n',\n",

       " 'sir george stokes and fluid dynamics.  sir george stokes, 1st baronet (1819-1903). on february 1, 1903, irish mathematician, physicist, politician and theologian sir george gabriel stokes, 1st baronet, passed away. stokes made seminal contributions to fluid dynamics, optics, and mathematical physics including the first version of what is now known as stokes’ theorem. george stokes was the youngest son of eight children of the reverend gabriel stokes, rector of skreen, county sligo, ireland, and elizabeth haughton. according to one of his obituary writers and colleagues john william strutt rayleigh (lord rayleigh), stokes had been a tempestuous and sometimes violent child. after attending schools in skreen and dublin, in 1835, at the age of 16 and after his father‘s death, george stokes moved to england and entered bristol college in bristol. in 1837, he entered pembroke college in cambridge, where he graduated after four years as senior wrangler (the top first class degree) in the mathematical tripos with tutor william hopkins and he was the first smith’s prizeman. pembroke college immediately gave him a fellowship. stokes‘ first published papers, which appeared in 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. these were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another on the effects of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums. to the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced by the nature of the gas in which the sound is produced. these inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships. his work on fluid motion and viscosity led to his calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium. this became known as stokes’ law. after he had deduced the correct equations of motion stokes discovered that again he was not the first to obtain the equations since navier, poisson and saint venant had already considered the problem. in fact this duplication of results was not entirely an accident, but was rather brought about by the lack of knowledge of the work of continental mathematicians at cambridge at that time. again stokes decided that his results were obtained with sufficiently different assumptions to justify publication and he published on the theories of the internal friction of fluids in motion in 1845. in 1849, stokes was appointed to the lucasian professorship of mathematics at cambridge, a position he held until his death in 1903. also in 1849 he wrote two papers on variable gravitation on the earth\\x92s surface which is said to have reformed the science of geodesy. while it was known that the force of gravity differed depending on where a person was on earth stokes claimed that this was not dependent upon the interior composition of the earth which had been assumed to be the case up until then. in 1851 he was elected to the royal society, awarded the rumford medal of that society in 1852, and he was appointed secretary of the society in 1854. the lucasian chair paid very poorly so stokes needed to earn additional money and he did this by accepting an additional position to the lucasian chair, namely that of professor of physics at the government school of mines in london.   stokes wrote various papers commenting on criticising and developing ideas first proposed by french mathematicians such as lagrange, laplace, fourier, poisson and cauchy. his interest led him to advocate changes to cambridge\\x92s tripos exam system to include more continental mathematics. this focus led some colleagues to label him a mathematician of the french tradition. however it is generally acknowledged the papers stokes wrote on mathematical topics were deeply related to his physical experiments. in 1854 stokes theorised an explanation of the fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. he suggested these were caused by atoms in the outer layers of the sun absorbing certain wavelengths. however when kirchhoff later published this explanation, stokes disclaimed any prior discovery. stokes’ career certainly took a rather different track in 1857 when he moved from his highly active theoretical research period into one where he became more involved with administration and experimental work. as part of his experimental drive stokes helped to set up the cavendish laboratory in the mid 1880s. stokes received the copley medal from the royal society in 1893 and he was given the highest possible honor by his college when he was elected as master of pembroke college in 1902at age 83. he did not hold this position for long, for he died at cambridge the following year.

       " 'gideon mantell and the iguanodon.  gideon mantell (1790-1852).  .  on february 3, 1790, english obstetrician, geologist and palaeontologist gideon algernon mantell was born. his attempts to reconstruct the structure and life of iguanodon began the scientific study of dinosaurs. in 1822 he was responsible for the discovery of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton, of iguanodon. moreover, mantell is also famous for his contributions on the cretaceous of southern england. well, the cretaceous is a geologic period from ca. 145 to 66 million years ago. in the geologic timescale, the cretaceous follows the jurassic period and is followed by the paleogene period of the cenozoic era. it is the last period of the mesozoic era, and, spanning 79 million years, the longest period of the phanerozoic eon. but more important – at least for me when i was a kid – the cretaceous also is famous for its dinosaurs. mantell was born in lewes, sussex, the child of thomas mantell, a shoemaker, and sarah austen. raised in a small cottage in st. mary‘s lane with his two sisters and four brothers, he showed a particular interest in the field of geology already at young age. the mantell children could not study at local grammar schools that were reserved for children of anglican faith, because the elder mantell was a follower of the methodist church. thus, gideon was educated at a dame school in st. mary‘s lane, and learned basic reading and writing from an old woman, and subsequently by john button, a philosophically radical whig who shared similar political beliefs with mantell‘s father. at age 15, mantell secured an apprenticeship with a local surgeon named james moore in lewes for a period of five years, in which he took care of mantell‘s dining, lodging and medical issues. mantell delivered moore’s medicines, kept his accounts, wrote out bills and extracted teeth from his patients.when his father died in 1807, mantell began to anticipate his medical education and taught himself human anatomy, followed by a formal medical education in london. he received his diploma as a member of the royal college of surgeons in 1811. mantell returned to lewes, and immediately formed a partnership with his former master, james moore. in the wake of the cholera, typhoid and smallpox epidemics, mantell found himself quite busy attending to more than 50 patients a day and delivering between 200 and 300 babies a year. although mainly occupied with running his busy country medical practice, he spent his little free time pursuing his passion, geology, often working into the early hours of the morning, identifying fossil specimens he found at the marl pits in hamsey. in 1813, mantell was elected as a fellow of the linnean society of london. two years later, he published his first paper, on the characteristics of the fossils found in the lewes area.   iguanodon remains found near maidstone inspired by mary anning‘s sensational discovery of a fossilized animal resembling a huge crocodile at lyme regis in dorset, mantell became passionately interested in the study of the fossilized animals and plants found in his area. the fossils he had collected from the region, near the weald in sussex, were from the chalk downlands covering the county. the chalk is part of the upper cretaceous system and the fossils it contains are marine in origin. but by 1819, mantell had begun acquiring fossils from a quarry, at whitemans green, near cuckfield. he named the new strata the strata of tilgate forest, after an historical wooded area and it was later shown to belong to the lower cretaceous. by 1820, he had started to find very large bones at cuckfield, even larger than those discovered by william buckland, at stonesfield in oxfordshire. then, in 1822, shortly before finishing his first book the fossils of south downs, while mantell was visiting a patient, his wife mary ann took a short stroll as she waited for him, and when mantell finished his house call, she presented him with a puzzling tooth. in fact, this account can’t be confirmed and there have been several conflicting accounts later. what’s certain is that the tooth was unlike anything mantell had ever seen. it was typical of an herbivore. could it belong to a mammal? mantell was confident that it came from mesozoic strata, and there were no mesozoic mammals known to science in the early 1820s. even today, there are few known mesozoic mammals of significant size, and mantell‘s tooth was huge. mantell showed the teeth to other scientists but they were dismissed as belonging to a fish or mammal and from a more recent rock layer than the other tilgate forest fossils. the eminent french anatomist, georges cuvier, identified the teeth as those of a rhinoceros. cuvier‘s dismissal was a blow to mantell‘s confidence, but ultimately he remained firm: this tooth, along with other remains he found, belonged to a giant herbivorous reptile from the mesozoic strata. he surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 18m in length.   mantell’s “iguanodon” restoration based on the maidstone mantellodon remains, 1834   years later, mantell had acquired enough fossil evidence to show that the dinosaur’s forelimbs were much shorter than its hind legs, therefore proving they were not built like a mammal as claimed by sir richard owen. mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil vertebrae, which owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to iguanodon. he also named a new genus of dinosaur called hylaeosaurus and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles. in 1833, mantell relocated to brighton but his medical practice suffered. he was almost rendered destitute, but for the town’s council who promptly transformed his house into a museum. the museum in brighton ultimately failed as a result of mantell‘s habit of waiving the entrance fee. finally destitute, mantell offered to sell the entire collection to the british museum, in 1838, and moved to clapham common in south london, where he continued his work as a doctor. in 1841 mantell was the victim of a terrible carriage accident and suffered a debilitating spinal injury. despite being bent, crippled and in constant pain, he continued to work with fossilised reptiles and published a number of scientific books and papers until his death in 1852 from an overdose of opium. at the time of his death mantell was credited with discovering 4 of the 5 genera of dinosaurs then known. at yovisto you can learn more about the interesting subject of paleontology in the ted talk of dr. paul sereno on ‘what can fossils teach us?‘.  \\n',\n",
       " 'john lindley and his love for plants.  john lindley (1799-1865).  .  on february 5, 1799, english botanist, gardener and orchidologist john lindley was born. his attempts to formulate a natural system of plant classification greatly aided the transition from the artificial (considering the characters of single parts) to the natural system (considering all characters of a plant). he made the first definitive orchid classification in 1830. john lindley was born in catton, near norwich, england, as one of four children of george linley, a nurseryman and pomologist who ran a commercial nursery garden, and his wife mary. although he had great horticultural knowledge, the undertaking was not profitable and the family lived in a state of indebtedness. as a boy john would assist in the garden and also collected wild flowers he found growing in the norfolk countryside. educated at norwich school, he would have liked to go to university or to buy a commission in the army but the family could not afford either. thus, he became belgian agent for a london seed merchant in 1815. at this time lindley became acquainted with the botanist william jackson hooker who allowed him to use his botanical library and who introduced him to sir joseph banks who offered him employment as an assistant in his herbarium. in 1819 he published his first scientific papers which were acknowledged by the linnaean society. lindley went to work at banks’ house in london. for his botanical interest he concentrated on the genera “rosa” and “digitalis” and published the monograph “a botanical history of roses” which distinguished seventy six species. he became acquainted with joseph sabine who grew a large assortment of roses and was the secretary of the horticultural society of london. his employment came to an abrupt end with the death of banks a few months later. in 1820, at the age of twenty one, lindley was elected a fellow of the linnean society of london. next, lindley was appointed assistant secretary to the horticultural society and its new garden at chiswick in 1822, where he supervised the collection of plants. in 1828 lindley was elected a fellow of the royal society of london and in 1833 was awarded the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy from the university of munich. in 1829 he was appointed to the chair of botany at university college, london, which he retained until 1860. plate from ‘a sketch of the vegetation of the swan river colony’ by john lindley, 1839 lindley’s investigation in 1838 of the conditions at the kew gardens in london led him to recommend that the gardens be turned over to the nation and used as the botanical headquarters for the united kingdom. his famous collection of orchids was eventually housed in the kew herbarium. his theory and practice of horticulture (1842) is considered to be one of the best books ever written on the physiological principles of horticulture. time consuming though his official duties and public activities certainly were, lindley nevertheless managed to prepare the specific characters for the 16712 species of flowering plants and cryptogams included in john loudon’s encyclopaedia of plants (1829) and to produce a series of well documented, clearly written, authoritative educational publications as a young man lindley campaigned vigorously against the artificial “sexual system” of classification of plants introduced by linnaeus in favor of a more natural system. in 1830 he published introduction to the natural system of botany which was the first work in english to give descriptions of the families on a worldwide basis. it embodied detailed, firsthand observations of their representatives in the garden and herbarium. uninfluenced by theories of evolution, and hence without thought of phylogeny, lindley regarded the characters of plants as “the living hieroglyphics of the almighty which the skill of man is permitted to interpret. the key to their meaning lies enveloped in the folds of the natural system.” in 1845, lindley was part of a scientific commission set up by the government to investigate potato blight and the irish famine. the cause of the fungal disease was not known at the time and the weather was thought to be to blame. in 1861, lindley took charge of organising the exhibits from the british colonies for the international exhibition at south kensington. this was exhausting work and seems to have taken a toll on his health. in 1863 he travelled to vichy, a spa in the south of france, but his health continued to decline. he died at his home at acton green, near london, aged 66. at yovisto, you can learn more about botany  in the video lecture on ‘human livelihoods depend on wild flowers: kew’s millennium seed bank explained‘.\\n',\n",

       " ' codd and the relational database model.  e. f. codd (1923-2003).  on august 23, 1923, english computer scientist edgar frank “ted” codd was born. his main achievement besides many contributions to computer science was the invention of the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases.   when you talk about databases today, usually you are referring to relational databases that store their data within tables, interconnected via so called keys. of course there are also modern alternatives such as e.g. graph based databases, but relational databases are widespread and rather common today. and this is also thanks to  codd and his relational algebra. edgar frank codd was born the youngest of seven children in portland bill, in dorset, england, in 1923. his father was a leather manufacturer, his mother a schoolteacher. after attending poole grammar school, he studied mathematics and chemistry at exeter college, oxford, before serving as a pilot in the royal air force during the second world war. in 1948 at age 25, he moved to new york to work for ibm as a mathematical programmer. in 1953, angered by senator joseph mccarthy, codd moved to ottawa, canada. while in canada, he established a computing center for the canadian guided missile program. a decade later he returned to the  and received his doctorate in computer science from the university of michigan in ann arbor. his thesis was about self replication in cellular automata, extending on work of von neumann and showing that a set of eight states was sufficient for universal computation and construction. two years later he moved to san jose, california, to work at ibm‘s san jose research laboratory, where he continued to work until the 1980s. there he found existing data management systems “seat of the pants, with no theory at all,” he recalled in one interview. “i began reading documentation,” codd said, “and i was disgusted.” . subsequently, codd worked out his theories of data arrangement, issuing his paper “a relational model of data for large shared data banks” in 1970, after an internal ibm paper one year earlier. in fact, the 1970 paper became one of the most important research papers in computer history. codd believed that all the information in a database should be represented as values in the rows and columns of tables, and that no information should be represented by pointers or connections among records. to his frustration, ibm largely ignored his work, as the company was investing heavily at the time in commercializing a different type of database system, the ims/db . then ibm included in its future systems project a system r subproject — but put in charge of it developers who were not thoroughly familiar with codd’s ideas, and isolated the team from codd. as a result, they did not use codd’s own alpha language but created a non relational one, sequel. even so, sequel was so superior to pre relational systems that it was copied, in 1979, based on pre launch papers presented at conferences, by larry ellison, of relational software inc, in his oracle database, which actually reached market before sql/ds — because of the then already proprietary status of the original name, sequel had been renamed sql. system r was a success, and in 1981 ibm announced its first relational database product, sql/ds. db2, initially for large mainframe machines, was announced in 1983 . codd continued to develop and extend his relational model, sometimes in collaboration with chris date. one of the normalized forms, the boyce–codd normal form, is named after him. codd’s theorem, a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of relational algebra and relational calculus (both of which, lacking recursion, are strictly less powerful than first order logic). as the relational model started to become fashionable in the early 1980s, codd fought a sometimes bitter campaign to prevent the term being misused by database vendors who had merely added a relational veneer to older technology. as part of this campaign, he published his 12 rules to define what constituted a relational database. this made his position in ibm increasingly difficult, so he left to form his own consulting company with chris date and others. nevertheless, codd was appointed ibm fellow in 1976. in 1981, codd was honoured with the turing award, the most prestigious award in computer science similar to the fields medal in mathematics. during the 1990s, his health deteriorated and he ceased work. codd died of heart failure at his home in williams island, florida, at the age of 79 on april 18, 2003. at yovisto you can watch a lecture from dr. jens peter dittrich from eth zürich about ‘dataspaces‘ where he is talking about codd’s relational model.\\n',\n",

he served in the us navy from 1944 to 1945. he holds a ba in mathematics from harvard (1950) and a phd in mathematics from princeton (1954). he taught at harvard before moving to the massachusetts institute of technology in 1957 as professor of mathematics, a post he occupied until 1962 when he became professor of electrical engineering. in the summer of 1956 minsky attended a conference on artificial intelligence (ai) at dartmouth, new hampshire. here, it was generally agreed that powerful modern computers would soon be able to simulate all aspects of human learning and intelligence. much of minsky’s later career has been spent testing this claim. in 1959 minsky and john mccarthy founded what is now known as the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory. under minsky’s direction a number of ai programs have been developed at mit. one of the earliest, a program to solve problems in calculus, showed that most problems could be solved by a careful application of about 100 rules. the computer actually received a grade a in an mit calculus exam. other programs developed such topics as reasoning by analogy, handling information expressed in english, and how to catch a bouncing ball with a robotic arm . already in 1951 as a student, minsky built the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, snarc. snarc is a randomly connected network of hebb synapses built in hardware using vacuum tubes, and was possibly the first artificial self learning machine. in general, artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by an animal’s central nervous systems (i.e. the brain) which is capable of machine learning as well as pattern recognition. they are generally presented as systems of interconnected “neurons” which can compute values from inputs. like other machine learning methods neural networks have been used to solve a wide variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule based programming, including computer vision and speech recognition. minsky’s inventions include the first head mounted graphical display (1963) and the confocal microscope (1957, a predecessor to today’s widely used confocal laser scanning microscope). together with seymour papert he developed the first logo “turtle”. logo is an educational programming language and a “turtle is something like a “robot” used in computer science and mechanical engineering training. turtles specifically designed for use with logo systems often come with pen mechanisms allowing the programmer to create a design on a large sheet of paper.   his seminal 1961 paper, “steps towards artificial intelligence” surveyed and analyzed what had been done before, and outlined many major problems that the infant discipline would later later need to face. the 1963 paper, “matter, mind, and models” addressed the problem of making self aware machines . in 1969 minsky wrote the book perceptrons (with seymour papert), which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks. this book is the center of a long standing controversy in the study of artificial intelligence. it is claimed that pessimistic predictions made by the authors were responsible for an erroneous change in the direction of research in ai, concentrating efforts on so called “symbolic” systems, and contributing to the so called ai winter, a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. this decision, supposedly, proved to be unfortunate in the 1980s, when new discoveries showed that the prognostics in the book were wrong. besides neural networks minsky also founded several other famous ai models. his book “a framework for representing knowledge” created a new paradigm in programming. while his “perceptrons” is now more a historical than practical book, the theory of frames is still a working concept in knowledge representation. minsky has also written on the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans, permitting communication. he was an adviser on stanley kubrick’s movie 2001: a space odyssey and is referred to in the movie as well as in arthur c. clarke’s original book. in the early 1970s at the mit artificial intelligence lab, minsky and seymour papert started developing what came to be called the society of mind theory. the theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non intelligent parts. minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children’s blocks. in 1986, minsky published the society of mind, a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for a general audience. minsky won the turing award in 1969 – the most prestigious award in computer science, and is currently the toshiba professor of media arts and sciences, and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit. the science fiction author isaac asimov described minsky as one of only two people he would admit were more intelligent than he was, the other being carl sagan. at yovisto you can listen to marvin minsky’s lecture series ‘the society of the mind‘ in which he is here referring to the concept of consciousness.\\n',\n",
       " 'dan bricklin and visicalc.  visicalc.  on july 16, 1951, computer scientist dan bricklin was born. together with bob frankston he created visicalc, the first spreadsheet computer program (1979) which created a market beyond hobbyists for the emerging personal computers. today, everybody knows spreadsheet programs, no matter if you choose a desktop application or a web based application, spreadsheets are everywhere. and sometimes, we don’t have any idea, how we could possibly get along without them. so, what is a spreadsheet? a spreadsheet is an interactive computer application program for organization and analysis of data in tabular form. spreadsheets developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets. the program operates on data represented as cells of an array, organized in rows and columns. the user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values, which is rather useful for “what if” analysis. in addition to the fundamental operations of arithmetic and mathematical functions, modern spreadsheets provide built in functions for common financial and statistical operations. but, how did it all start? it was dan bricklin, born in 1951 into a jewish family in philadelphia, usa. he earned a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and computer science from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1973. upon graduating from mit, bricklin worked for digital equipment corporation (dec) until 1976, when he began working for fasfax, a cash register manufacturer. in 1977, he returned to school and he earned a master of business administration from harvard university in 1979. it was in his last year in harvard business school, when bricklin was watching a presentation that gave him the first idea for visicalc. the professor was creating a financial model on a blackboard that was ruled with lines to create a table, and formulas and data were being written into the cells. when the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite a number of sequential entries in the table. bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an “electronic spreadsheet” to view results of underlying formulae. bricklin was joined by bob frankston, and the pair worked on visicalc for two months during the winter of 1978–79, forming software arts. visicalc was first published for the apple ii personal computer. the power of the visicalc concept was noticed immediately and for the first 12 months it was only available for the apple ii computer, and became that platform’s killer app. visicalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, visicalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. this turned 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity. in its 1980 review, byte wrote “the most exciting and influential piece of software that has been written for any microcomputer application is visicalc“. visicalc sold over 700000 copies in six years, and as many as 1 million copies over its history. when lotus 1-2-3 was launched in 1983, taking full advantage of the expanded memory of the pc and added integrated charting, plotting and database capabilities, visicalc sales practically ended overnight. sales imploded so rapidly that the company was soon insolvent. the next milestone for spreadsheets was the microsoft excel spreadsheet. excel was originally written for the 512k apple macintosh in 1984-1985 and was one of the first spreadsheets to use a graphical interface with pull down menus and a point and click capability using a mouse pointing device. spreadsheets have even found there way into popular culture. as for example in douglas adams novel “dirk gently’s holistic detective agency“ he describes a character named richard macduff, a young software engineer. macduff is the programmer of a rather popular application called anthem, which is designed as a spreadsheet, but also has a unique feature to convert corporate accounts into music. i really would appreciate a feature like that at yovisto you can watch dan bricklin himself in a talk he gave at startupbootcamp telling the story of visicalc.\\n',\n",
       " 'the antikythera mechanism – an ancient analog computer.  the antikythera mechanism.  on may 17, 1902, greek archaeologist valerios stais discovers the antikythera mechanism, an ancient mechanical analog computer, designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses. the famous mechanism was discovered in a shipwreck near the greekisland of antikythera. in october 1900, a group of sponge divers discovered the wreck and retrieved a great number of artifacts dating back to the end of the second century bc, which included bronze and marble statues, pottery, glassware, jewelry, coins, and of course, the mechanism. all together, they were brought to the national museum of archaeology in athens for research purposes. however, the mechanism itself stayed unnoticed for over two years. the big clot of corroded bronze and wood looked pretty inconspicuous to the museum staff and they decided that other pieces had a higher priority. it took two more years until archaeologist valerios stais found out that one of the pieces belonging to the mechanism had some kind of gear wheel embedded in it. the scientist immediately thought of an astronomical clock, but most of the archeologists examining the mechanism from then on believed it to be prochronistic due to its incredible complexity. unfortunately for stais, the investigations on the device were dropped. the physicist, historian of science, and information scientist derek j. de solla price increased his interest in the mechanism in 1951. along with the greek nuclear physicist charalampos karakalos he took x ray and gamma ray images and published a very large scientific paper on their findings in the 1970s. it was quickly realized, how important the mechanism was and cardiff university professor michael edmunds, who led a 2006 study of the mechanism, described the device as “more valuable than the mona lisa“. antikythera machine mechanical model image: mogi vicentini derek price concluded that the device was an astronomical computer capable of predicting the positions of the sun and moon in the zodiac on any given date. a new analysis, though, suggests that the device was even more complex than the scientist thought and reinforces the evidence for his theory of an ancient greek tradition of complex mechanical technology. today, the device is often called the first analog computer. however, it is also assumed that the mechanism may have had predecessors during the hellenistic period that remained undiscovered. one of the things that astonished the experts the most was the high level of miniaturisation and overall complexity that was for example seen in 14th century astronomical clocks. since research on the device progressed only slowly and needed decent funding, the antikythera mechanism research project was initiated in 2005. it is an international collaboration of academic researchers, which aims to completely reassess the function and significance of the antikythera mechanism. recent findings of the project suggest that the concept for the mechanism originated in the colonies of corinth, since some of the astronomical calculations seem to indicate observations that can be made only in corinth area of ancient greece. also, a connection to the school of archimedes is assumed, since syracuse was a colony of corinth and the home of the inventor, mathematician and engineer. but this is not the only theory regarding the device’s origin. some historians assume that it may have been built in the ancient greek city of pergamon. it was found out that the mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank which was linked via a crown gear to the largest gear. this allowed the setting of the date on the front dial and the calculation of the position of the sun and moon and other astronomical information was possible. it is known that the device has at least 30 gears, but on this day it is still argued whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient greeks. it is assumed that the gears were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools and with the help of x ray images, the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments could be determined and thus, the basic operation of the device was revealed. another point that was highly discussed was the question whether the mechanism was based on the geocentric or even the heliocentric model. it was then found out that since the device’s purpose was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the celestial sphere, in reference to the observer’s position on the earth, the device was based on the geocentric model. in 2012, the woods hole oceanographic institution in the united states received permission from the greek government to conduct new dives around the deep shoals of antikythera. the researchers hope to find other small pieces of the antikythera mechanism on the sea floor as well as to locating and surveying the wrecks of other ships that foundered near the island. at yovisto, you may be interested in a discussion about ‘the technology of the antikythera mechanism‘ at the getty museum.\\n',\n",
       " 'rudy rucker – infinity and the mind.  rudy rucker, fall 2004, photo by georgia rucker.  on march 22, 1946, american mathematician, computer scientist, science fiction author, and philosopher rudolph von bitter rucker, better known as rudy rucker, was born. he is also one of the founders of the cyberpunk literary movement. rucker was born and raised in louisville, kentucky, where his father embry cobb rucker, sr., a descended from flemish huguenots, ran a small furniture manufacturing company. later in life, embry cobb rucker, sr. became an episcopal minister and worked as parish priest for the rest of his life. his mother, marianne von bitter originally was from berlin and came to study at the pennsylvania academy of fine arts in philadelphia in 1937. she was an enthusiastic gardener, amateur artist and potter. moreover, she also was a descendent of famous german philosopher georg wilhelm friedrich hegel. rucker attended st. xavier high school before earning a  in mathematics from swarthmore college in 1967 and  (1969) and phd (1973) degrees in mathematics from rutgers university with a specialization on mathematical logic. in 1972, rucker started teaching in the math. dept. at the state university college at geneseo, new york, with a “higher geometry” course, which turned into a series of lectures on the fourth dimension. eventually he wrote the lectures up as geometry, relativity and the fourth dimension, published by dover publications, which should become the foundation of his writing career. thanks to a grant from the german alexander von humboldt foundation, rucker taught math at the ruprecht karl university of heidelberg from 1978 to 1980. he then taught at randolph macon women’s college in lynchburg, virginia from 1980 to 1982, before trying his hand as a full time author. inspired by an interview with british scientist stephen wolfram, rucker became a computer science professor at san josé state university in 1986, from which he retired in 2004. “computationsare everywhere, once you begin to look at things in a certain way.” (rudy rucker) a mathematician with philosophical interests, rucker published infinity and the mind in 1982. the book contains accessible popular expositions on the mathematical theory of infinity, and a number of related topics. these include gödel’s incompleteness theorems and their relationship to concepts of artificial intelligence and the human mind, as well as the conceivability of some unconventional cosmological models. the material is approached from a variety of viewpoints, some more conventionally mathematical and others being nearly mystical. as his “own alternative to cyberpunk,” rucker developed a writing style he terms transrealism. the essence of transrealism, as outlined in his 1983 essay “the transrealist manifesto,” is to write about one’s real life in fantastic terms. the secret of life, white light, and the sex sphere are examples of his transreal novels. the first recasts a traditional coming of age memoir as a ufo novel, the second is about rucker’s time as a mystical mathematician at suny geneseo, while the third turns his two years in germany into a tale of higher dimensions and nuclear terrorism. rucker is presently working on a 1950s sf novel called the turing chronicles, featuring a love affair between computer pioneer alan turing and beat author william burroughs. rucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas; white light examines the concept of infinity, while the ware tetralogy is in part an explanation of the use of natural selection to develop software. his non fiction book, the lifebox, the seashell, and the soul: what gnarly computation taught me about ultimate reality, the meaning of life, and how to be happy summarizes the various philosophies he’s believed over the years and ends with the tentative conclusion that we might profitably view the world as made of computations, with the final remark, “perhaps this universe is perfect.” at yovisto you can watch rudy rucker delivering a rather interesting talk at tedx brussels 2012 about “beyond machines: the year 3000“.\\n',\n",
       " '. licklider and interactive computing.  a sage operator’s terminal image: joi ito.  on march 11, 1915, american psychologist and computer scientist . licklider, known simply as . or “lick“, was born. he is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern style interactive computing and was one of the most distinguished internet pioneers. licklider was born in st. louis, missouri and his engineering talents became clear pretty early, when he built model airplanes as a child. he enrolled at washington university in st. louis, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in 1937. licklider received his master degree one year later, majoring in physics, psychology, and mathematics. after receiving a phd in psychoacoustics from the university of rochester in 1942, licklider moved to harvard where he started working at the psycho acoustic laboratory.  licklider licklider’s interest in information technologies evolved in the late 1940s. his early ideas foretold of graphical computing, point and click interfaces, digital libraries, e commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate wherever it was needed. the scientist moved to mit, where he was appointed associate professor and served a committee that established a psychology program for engineering students. also, he worked on the sage program, a semi automatic ground environment creating a computer aided air defense system. licklider worked there as a human factors experts, which convinced him of the great potential for computer interfaces. licklider became a vice president at bolt beranek and newman, inc., where he bought the first production pdp 1 computer and conducted the first public demonstration of time sharing. at darpa, licklider continued his career, where he became the head of the information processing techniques office. shortly after, he was named director of behavioral science. this version led to the precursor of today’s internet, the arpanet. licklider also did some seminal early work for the council on library resources, imagining what libraries of the future might look like and describing them as “thinking centers.” licklider became part of the mac project at mit, where a large mainframe computer was designed to be shared by up to 30 simultaneous users, each sitting at a so called typewriter terminal. the first computer time sharing system and one of the first online setups with the development of multics were established. during his active years in computer science, licklider managed to conceive, manage, and research the fundamentals that led to modern computers and the internet as we know it today. his 1960 scientific paper on the man computer symbiosis was revolutionary and foreshadowed interactive computing. this inspired many other scientists to continue early efforts on time sharing and application development. one of the scientists funded by licklider’s efforts was the famous american computer scientist douglas engelbart, whose efforts led to the invention of the computer mouse. at yovisto, you may be interested in the 1972 documentary ‘computer networks: heralds of the resource sharing‘, which shows some great people (including  licklider) who were designing and operating open networks which were eventually developed to what we now know as the internet.\\n',\n",
       " 'the birth of the internet.  on october 29, 1969, the very first message between two distant computer nodes, from the network measurement center at the ucla’s school of engineering and applied science and sri international (sri) was sent. this is to be considered the birth of the arpanet, which should become the internet.  what was the reason for the development of the internet? especially in the 1960s, when computers were absolutely not widespread or ubiquitous as today. moreover, computers in the 1960s did not follow the same or similar hardware and software architecture. this means that for two computers to communicate, a special translation interface must be constructed either way by hardware and by software. on the other hand, we are in the 1960s. in the late 1940s, thomas watson, founder of ibm stated “i think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” we know that he was wrong. but, there were only a few computers around concentrating on research laboratories, universities, or working for the military. the founding myth of the internet always refers to the so called “sputnik shock” as being the initial event. on october 4, 1957, the soviet launched the very first satellite into orbit. thus, proving that they were also able to reach the usa with their ballistic missiles. this first strike capability gave them a significant advantage in the times of cold war. us president eisenhower in response founded the arpa, the advanced research projects agency, to catch up the soviet’s military and scientific advantage. one of the many projects being founded by arpa was also computer network communication. something exotic, considering the times and the circumstances. but, nevertheless, in times of potential nuclear thread it seemed not to be difficult to come up with an argument to support also the funding of more or less ‘esoterical’ technologies.  for this reason you might read that the internet was developed as response to he soviet nuclear threat to enable fault tolerant computer network communication that will also work when parts of the communication network might get destroyed by a nuclear blast (or something else). the internet’s fault tolerance really is something extraordinary, compared to the previous switching networks that failed, whenever some relay station went out of service and the network traffic had to be explicitly rerouted. the internet is based on the principle of packet switching. thus, contrariwise to the way traditional telephone services are working – i.e. a connection between sender and receiver is established and along the switched connection the entire message is transferred, blocking the communication for other parties until the message is received completely – packet switching splits the message in small packets that are sent independently over various routes within the network. this has several advantages: first, a connection is only blocked for the time one small packet needs to travel from sender to receiver. other users might also send their packets in between the packets from the original sender. second, if a packet got lost, only the packet has to be retransmitted instead of the entire message. thus making network communication more efficient. the principle of packet switching was already developed by paul baran from rand corporation in 1959.  the earliest ideas for a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users were formulated by j. c. r. licklider of bolt, beranek and newman (bbn), in april 1963, in memoranda discussing his concept for an “intergalactic computer network“. those ideas contained almost everything that composes the contemporary internet. in october 1963, licklider was appointed head of the behavioral sciences and command and control programs at the defense department‘s advanced research projects agency — arpa (the initial arpanet acronym). he then convinced ivan sutherland and bob taylor that this computer network concept was very important and merited development, although licklider left arpa before any contracts were let that worked on this concept. ivan sutherland and bob taylor continued their interest in creating such a computer communications network, in part, to allow arpa sponsored researchers at various corporate and academic locales to put to use the computers arpa was providing them, and, in part, to make new software and other computer science results quickly and widely available. in his office, taylor had three computer terminals, each connected to separate computers, which arpa was funding: the first, for the system development corporation (sdc) q 32, in santa monica  “for each of these three terminals, i had three different sets of user commands. so, if i was talking online with someone at ., and i wanted to talk to someone i knew at berkeley, or ., about this, i had to get up from the . terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. i said, “oh man!”, it’s obvious what to do: if you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. that idea is the arpanet“. the problem remains that for connecting a number of computers of various architectures, you need one dedicated interface between each pair of connected computers. thus, for 4 computers, you will need 6 interfaces, for 5 computers, you will need 10, for 6 computers, you will need 15, for 10 computers you will need 45 and for 100 computers even 4950 interfaces. the growth of the number of required interfaces would be quadratic. therefor, robert taylor developed the following plan: a network composed of small computers called interface message processors (imps: today called routers), that functioned as gateways interconnecting local resources. at each site, the imps performed store and forward packet switching functions, and were interconnected with modems that were connected to leased lines, initially running at 50kbit per second. the host computers were connected to the imps via custom serial communication interfaces. in this way, communication was performed in a subnetway and only for each hardware architecture exactly one interface had to be developed to connect to the subnetway.  the first four computers connected to the now called arpanet were an sds sigma 7 from the university of california, los angeles (ucla), an sds 940 from the stanford research institute’s augmentation research center, an ibm 360 75 from university of california, santa barbara (ucsb), and a dec pdp 10 from university of utah‘s computer science department. the first message on the arpanet was sent by ucla student programmer charley kline, at 10:30 pm on 29 october 1969, from boelter hall 3420. kline transmitted from the university’s sds sigma 7 host computer to the stanford research institute’s sds 940 host computer. the message text was the word login  at yovisto you can learn

       " 'fortran – the first programming language for numeric calculations.  cover of the fortran automatic coding system, the first book about fortran.  on october 15, 1956, the reference manual for the programming language fortran – the ibm mathematical formula translating system – was published. it is considered the very first high level programming language. fortran was developed at ibm under the guidance of john w. backus to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their ibm 704 mainframe computer. fortran became to dominate the area of numerical programming early on and has been in continual use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics and computational chemistry. the story of fortran begins in late 1953, when computer scientist john w. backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at ibm to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their ibm 704 mainframe computer. if you are not a programmer, you have to know that programming in assembly language means to break an abstract programming problem down into machine instructions. thus, blowing up simple algorithmic tasks to complex problems, which are rather hard to manage and to maintain. moreover, assembly language depends always on the computer’s architecture and thus, programs written in assembly language won’t be able to be shared among several different computers. therefor, soon the idea of a high level programming language came up, raising the tedious task of programming to a more abstract level, and enabling programs to be generally portable across multiple architectures. to achieve this, higher level programming languages must be (automatically) translated into machine instructions with the help of a special program called interpreter or compiler. “god is real, unless declared integer.” (j. allan toogood, fortran programmer) john w. backus‘ historic fortran team consisted of programmers richard goldberg, sheldon f. best, harlan herrick, peter sheridan, roy nutt, robert nelson, irving ziller, lois haibt, and david sayre. one of the most important concepts to be realized included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by j. halcombe laning and demonstrated in his george compiler of 1952. a draft specification for the ibm mathematical formula translating system was completed by mid 1954. the first manual for fortran then appeared in october 15, 1956, with the first fortran compiler delivered in april 1957. the main problem of early compilers was efficiency, i.e. the translation process from higher level programming language into machine instructions usually ended up in sub optimal machine programs, which compared to hand coded machine programs were much more complex and also slower in the execution. therefore, the fortran compiler was realized as an optimizing compiler, because customers were reluctant to use a high level programming language unless its compiler could generate code whose performance was comparable to that of hand coded assembly language. “the determined real programmer can write fortran programs in any language.” (ed post, real programmers don’t use pascal, 1982) while the community was skeptical that this new method could possibly outperform hand coding, it reduced the number of programming statements necessary to operate a machine by the incredible factor of 20, and therefore quickly gained acceptance. john backus said during a 1979 interview with ‘think, the ibm employee magazine’, “much of my work has come from being lazy. i didn’t like writing programs, and so, when i was working on the ibm 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, i started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.“ fortran was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. the inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering. significantly, the increasing popularity of fortran spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide fortran compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 more than 40 fortran compilers for various computer architectures existed. for these reasons, fortran is considered to be the first widely used programming language supported across a variety of computer architectures. as a short example of fortran programming code, here is fortran version of the ‘hello world’-program: program helloworld print *, “hello, world!” end program helloworld also by today, fortran is still one of the most popular languages in the area of high performance computing and is the language used for programs that benchmark and rank the world’s fastest supercomputers. at yovisto you can learn more about the origins of the first mathematical high level programming language fortran in the short documentary ‘the beginnings of

       " 'john atanasoff and the first electronic digital computer.  john vincent atanasoff (1903-1995). on october 4, 1903, american physicist and inventor john vincent atanasoff was born. he is best known for being considered as one of the inventors of the electronic digital computer. even computer scientists most probably haven’t heard anything of this computer pioneer. of course you will have heard about alan turing or john von neumann, who are traditionally referenced as being the fathers of the computer. maybe, when you are european or even german, then you most probably will have heard of konrad zuse, who in near total intellectual isolation constructed the first universal computer z3, which became operational in may 1941. so why is it, we haven’t heard of john atanasoff john atanasoff, of bulgarian, french and irish ancestry, was born on october 4, 1903 in hamilton, new york to ivan atanasoff, an electrical engineer and a school teacher, who had immigrated to the united states in 1889. atanasoff’s mother, iva lucena purdy, was a teacher of mathematics. atanasoff was raised in brewster, florida. already at the age of nine he learned to use a slide rule and logarithms. in 1925, he received his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from the university of florida and continued at iowa state college, where he earned his master’s degree in mathematics in 1926. in 1930 by he received a phd in theoretical physics from the university of wisconsin–madison and accepted a professorship at iowa state college in mathematics and physics. while working at his phd thesis, atanasoff became rather frustrated about the available mechanical calculation machines and began to search for faster methods of computation. in 1936 atanasoff invented an analog calculator for analyzing surface geometry. the fine mechanical tolerance required for good accuracy pushed him to consider digital solutions. according to atanasoff, several operative principles of his famous invention, the atanasoff–berry computer (abc), were conceived in a flash of insight during the winter of 1937–1938 after a drive to rock island, illinois. one night in a bar on the illinois iowa border, after another frustrating day performing tedious mathematical calculations in his lab, atanasoff hit on the idea that the binary number system and electronic switches, combined with an array of capacitors on a moving drum to serve as memory, could yield a computing machine that would make his life as a scientist easier. with a grant of $650 received in september 1939 atanasoff went back to his office and with the assistance of his graduate student clifford berry, he built the machine by november of that year. the prototype really worked. the whole world changed. the key ideas employed in the abc included binary math and boolean logic to solve up to 29 simultaneous linear equations. the abc had no central processing unit (cpu), but was designed as an electronic device using vacuum tubes for digital computation. it also used separate regenerative capacitor memory that operated by a process still used today in dram memory. between 1954 and 1973, atanasoff was a witness in the legal actions brought by various parties to invalidate electronic computing patents issued to john mauchly and j. presper eckert, who designed eniac, the first general purpose electronic digital computer. the patents were owned by computer manufacturer sperry rand. but in 1973 a court declared that the patent on the sperry rand univac device was invalid and declared atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer, opening the intellectual property gates to the computer revolution. in 1980, dr. john atanasoff gave a lecture at the digital computer museum in massachusetts, where he discusses his life, the events that lead to his breakthroughs in computing and the design of the atanasoff–berry computer.\\n',\n",
       " 'gnu’s not unix.  on september 27, 1983, american software freedom activist and computer programmer richard stallman announced the gnu project. its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software. you’ve probably never heard of gnu, unless you are a computer scientist or some kind of software developer. but, gnu denotes the starting point of a development that still continues today – the concept of public domain software, with gnu as a unix like operating system that started it all leading to other public domain operating systems such as freebsd or linux. the unix operating system is a multitasking, multi user computer operating system originally developed in 1969 by a group of at&t employees at bell labs, including among others ken thompson, dennis ritchie, brian kernighan. unix soon became rather popular because it was written in a high level programming language(instead of assembly language), it was based on a rather simple file data structure(everything in the file system was treated as simple byte arrays), and it came with lots of rather useful little tools that made the life of a programmer so much easier. but, of course it was proprietary software. this means that a single company took hold of the copyright and decided about future improvements, extensions, and development of the operating system. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture began to fragment. to prevent software from being used on their competitors’ computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution.in 1980, richard stallman, an employee from the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) artificial intelligence laboratory together with some other hackers at the ai lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed laser printer, the xerox 9700. stallman had modified the software for the lab’s previous laser printer, so it electronically messaged a user when the person’s job was printed, and would message all logged in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users.this experience convinced stallman of people’s need to be free to modify the software they use. as a reaction to these events, richard stallman publicly announced the gnu project on september 27, 1983 on the net.unix wizards and net.usoft newsgroups, an ambitious effort to create a free software unix like system; “free” in that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. stallman argued that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbor and to be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. he maintains that attempts by proprietary softwarevendorsto prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical. “as an operating system developer, i had the right skills for this job. so even though i could not take success for granted, i realized that i was elected to do the job. i chose to make the system compatible with unix so that it would be portable, and so that unix users could easily switch to it.” (richard stallman on gnu) gnu software development began on january 5, 1984, when stallman quit his job at the massachusetts institute of technology so that they could not claim ownership or interfere with distributing gnu as free software. in 1985, stallman published the gnu manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called gnu, which would be compatible with unix. the name gnu is a recursive acronym for “gnu’s not unix.” soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the free software foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. furthermore, he popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. it was first implemented in the gnu emacs general public license, and in 1989 the first program independent gnu general public license (gpl) was released. in 1991, linus torvalds, a finnish student, used the gnu development tools to produce the linux kernel. the existing programs from the gnu project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. stallman‘s influences on hacker culture also include the famous emacs editor. on unix systems, gnu emacs‘s popularity rivaled that of another editor vi, spawning an editor war. stallman‘s take on this was to canonize himself as st. ignucius of the church of emacs and acknowledge that “vi vi vi is the editor of the beast,” while “using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance“. while on the other side supporters of vi have created an opposing cult of viand argued by the more hardline emacs users to be an attempt to “ape their betters“. richard stallman has written many essays on software freedom and since the early 1990s has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement, which he has devoted the bulk of his life. at yovisto you can learn more about software freedom activist richard stallman in a lecture he gave at the university of calgary in 2005 on ‘the danger of software patents‘.\\n',\n",
       " 'space invaders!.  space invaders image:  adlen in early june 1978 – we have not been able to determine the exact date – the famous arcade video game space invaders designed by tomohiro nishikado was released by the japanese taito corporation. space invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of attacking aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. as the invaders were shot down one by one, their march grew faster and faster, until a lone invader sped across the screen. if you managed to hit them all, a new wave of invaders would take to the sky. but if the aliens were able to hit ground zero, it was game over for you and for the earth. with the inspiration of atari’s game breakout, tomohiro nishikado spent one year planning, designing and developing the needed hardware for the game. if you believe it or not, the game was in the sense of its graphics alot more advanced than breakout. also the game play was a bit more complex and allowed the player to shoot moving objects instead of static ones. the developer faced the difficulty of creating flying objects after he thought of using a space theme and found that computing humans would be alot easier but immoral in his eyes. the figures in the game were created after nishikado saw a movie adaptation of  well’s ‘war of the worlds‘. he had to build his own hardware because the common microcomputers in japan were not powerful back then for designing a game of such a complexity. for his programming purposes, nishikado created the arcade board with new microprocessors imported from the , but even those were not quite as powerful as nishikado wished. however, the game was released in black and white at first, the colored monsters were published a bit later. soon after the game’s release in japan, whole new arcades with space invader cabinets opened and it became widely popular. only a few months after the release, more than 100000 machines were set up. 500000 plus coin op machines were sold worldwide in the first year, seventy percent of which remained in japan. space invaders not only depicted the world’s most famous arcade game of its time, but was also seen as the ‘killer app’ for the upcoming game consoles. the high popularity of the games was, as specialists later found, the fact that it depicted one of the most complex shooting games of its time because the enemy targets shot back for the first time. actually, in japan demand for the arcade game was so great that it led to a coin shortage and prompted an increase in production of the 100-yen coin. at yovisto, you may enjoy the original human space invader performance made by guillaume reymond in switzerland.\\n',\n",

       " 'eniac – the first computer introduced into public.  the eniac.  on february 13, 1946, j. presper eckert and john mauchly introduced electronic numerical integrator and computer, or eniac, the first general purpose, electronic computer. eniac was a giant step forward in computing technology. actually, the research that lead to the development of eniac was sponsored by the us military. the army needed a computer for calculating artillery firing tables, the settings used for different weapons under varied conditions for target accuracy. the ballistics research laboratory (brl), the branch of the military responsible for calculating these tables, heard about john mauchly‘s research at the university of pennsylvania, who had previously created several calculating machines, some with small electric motors inside. in 1942, mauchly had begun designing an improved calculating machine based on the work of john atanasoff that would use vacuum tubes to speed up calculations. finally, on may 31, 1943, the military commission on the new computer began with 32 year old john mauchly as chief consultant and 24 year old john presper eckert jr., a genius graduate student from moore school, as chief engineer. it took the team about one year to design the eniac and 18 months and us$ 500000 to build it. nevertheless, by the time they had finished construction, the war was over. but, the eniac was still put to work by the military doing calculations for, as e.g., the design of hydrogen bombs, weather prediction, cosmic ray studies, but also wind tunnel design. the eniac combined, for the first time, the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. it could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. it also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. high speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). built under the direction of john mauchly and j. presper eckert at the university of pennsylvania, eniac‘s development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. the machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, and contained over 18000 vacuum tubes. one of the major engineering feats was to minimize tube burnout, which was a common problem at that time. the machine was in almost constant use for the next ten years. eniac employed paper card readers obtained from ibm, by the time a long established part of ibm‘s business accounting machines. during operation, the eniac was silent but you knew it was on as the 18000 vacuum tubes each generated waste heat like a light bulb and 174000 wattsof heat meant that the computer could only be operated in a specially designed room with its own heavy duty air conditioning system. one of the most difficult problems to solve was that eniac‘s design would require 18000 vacuum tubes to all work simultaneously. but, vacuum tubes were notoriously unreliable. the idea that 18000 tubes could work together was considered so unlikely that the dominant vacuum tube supplier of the day, rca, first refused to join the project. by the time eniac was working, about 2000 of the computer’s vacuum tubes had to be replaced each month by a team of six technicians. eniac was definitively a so called ‘turing complete’ device, i.e. it was not restricted to special problems, but could compute any problem – well, of course only if this problem would fit in the considerably small memory. a “program” on the eniac, however, was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine. six women did most of the programming of eniac. improvements completed in 1948 made it possible to execute stored programs set in function table memory, which made programming less a “one off” effort, and more systematic. about 10 percent of the historic computer lives on in the same basement room where it was created. eniac‘s 50th anniversary was celebrated in 1996 with a visit by vice president al gore. what was left of the old computer was fired up one last time. today, eniac is generally closed but special arrangement can be made to see it by contacting the university’s electrical engineering school at 33rd and walnut. eckert and mauchley eventually formed their own company, which was later bought by the rand corporation.they produced the universal automatic computer (univac), which was the first commercially available computer, but this is a completely different story… at yovisto, you may enjoy a short documentation on eniac.  \\n',\n",

       " 'konrad zuse – the inventor of the computer.  konrad zuse (1910 – 1995).  on december 18, 1995, german engineer and computer pioneer konrad zuse passed away. he is renowned to have constructed the very first functional program controlled turing complete computer, the z3, which became operational in may 1941. konrad zuse developed the ability to build various kinds of machines in his early high school years, and he began his engineering career at berlin’s technical university, where he earned his degree in 1935. right after graduating, the inventor quit his promising engineering job at a company, responsible for transport machines and aircrafts. when he told his parents, he needed their entire living room to construct a machine that was able to do the moronic work of calculating automatically, he earned much astonishment, but also their complete support. so this is, where one of the greatest inventions of all times started – in an ordinary family’s living room in berlin kreuzberg, just a few years before world war ii. zuse was going to build a binary calculating machine based on mechanical bistable elements continuing the works of the congenial 19th century english mathematician charles babbage. also, the entire machine was supposed to be based on propositional logic, which he developed the famous floating point execution unit for. zuse built a memory, as well as a control unit made of punched tape, which he received from the babelsberg film studios and finished his first mechanical computer, the z1 in 1938.  because of the limited resources, konrad zuse was not quite satisfied with this new very loudly calculating “monstrosity” he had created at his parent’s home. he made a few adjustments, like using telephone relays and designed the z2 right after. he refined further details and partly financially supported by the government, konrad zuse was able to finish his famous z3, the first computer world wide that was freely programmable and based on the binary number system as well as a binary circuit technology in 1941. the construction of the z4 began in 1942, but due to world war ii, zuse could not finish it in berlin, wherefore he moved it to neukirchen in hessen, germany. you may imagine, that moving a whole computer system (as big as a whole shelf unit and as heavy as a small car) in germany near the end of the war was definitely not a walk in the park. because all other machines have been destroyed by the bombs, the z4 was everything he had left and therefore the move was even more risky. but fortunately, zuse and his team made it just on time and five years after the war, the machine was completely reconstructed and calculated from then on at the eth zurich as the only commercial computing system in europe. after the z3 and z4, zuse was still motivated to build and sell fully automatic calculating machines, wherefore he founded a company in neukirchen. zuse and his wife, who lead the business sold more than 250 computers across europe. another problem, regarding the z3 was zuse’s recognition as the inventor of the computer. howard aiken presented the mark 1 in 1944 in the usa, but zuse’s z3 was destroyed during world war ii and only some sketches remained. however, he could collect numerous evidences for his achievement and during a mathematical conference concerning the fact ‘who invented the computer‘, a huge majority spoke for konrad zuse. unfortunately, this was in 1998, three years after zuse’s passing, but after this, he received the computer history museum fellow award, to be seen as the usa’s acknowledgement. also, in 2010, the ‘zuse year’ was announced to honor his contributions and to emphasize the importance of his invention to the digital age. at yovisto you can learn more about computer pioneer konrad zuse in a talk given by his son, prof. horst zuse, about his father and the invention of the computer (in german language).\\n',\n",

       " 'charles babbage – the father of the computer who hated street music.  drawing of charles babbage‘s famous difference engine.  on october 18, 1871, charles babbage, mathematician, inventor and early computer scientist passed away. we think, everybody should know about charles babbage and his seminal work on the first mechanical universal computer, the analytical engine. although the analytical engine never was build during his lifetime, due to the lack of according fine mechanics in the 19th century, babbage sketched out everything necessary to construct and to program a universal computer. born in teignmouth, devonshire on december 26, 1791 as son of benjamin babbage, a fairly wealthy london banker, charles babbage suffered from many childhood illnesses, which forced his family to send him to a clergy operated school for special care. during his younger years, he received private tutoring from elite school teachers due to the wealth of his father. when he went to trinity college, cambridge, in october 1810, he was turned off by the sort of math that was taught, so together with his friend john herschel, the later famous astronomer, he decided to form his own math group known as the analytical society who would apply scientific logic and thought to test mathematical ideas of the time. when, in 1812, babbage transferred to peterhouse, cambridge, he was the best mathematician in the times of babbage there was a really high error rate in the calculation of math tables, when babbage planned to find a new method that could be use to make it mechanically, removing the human error factor. this idea started to tickle his brain very early, in 1812. three different elements influenced him in this decision: he disliked untidiness and unprecision; he was very able with logarithmical tables; he was inspired from an existing work on calculating machines produced by schickard, pascal, and leibniz. he discussed the main principles of a calculating engine in a letter he wrote to sir humphrey davy in the early 1822. by that time babbage began developing his difference engine, a mechanical device that could calculate and tabulate polynomial functions, but he was unable to complete it because of a lack of funding. the name ‘difference engine‘ derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients. both logarithmic and trigonometric functions, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful sets of numbers for navigators and scientists. in the 1830s babbage began developing his analytical engine, which was designed to carry calculations guided by a programming logic, but this device was never built. babbage’s book economy of machines and manufactures (1832) initiated the field of study known today as operational research. unfortunately, little remains of babbage’s prototype computing machines. critical tolerances required by his machines exceeded the level of technology available at the time. and, though babbage’s work was formally recognized by respected scientific institutions, the british government suspended funding for his difference engine in 1832. one year later ada augusta king, countess of lovelace, the only legitimate child of the famous poet lord byron, met babbage and was fascinated with both him and his computers. she became a competent student of mathematics, which was most unusual for a woman at the time. it is often suggested that ada was the world’s first programmer. unfortunately, babbage was never able to complete his analytical engine, and the concept was shelved and forgotten until 1937 when many of his unpublished notebooks were discovered. finally, in 1991, british scientists got around to constructing a machine called difference engine no. 2 (accurate to 31 digits) built according to babbage’s detailed specifications. according to the account of lady lovelace babbage hated music. he tolerated its more exquisite forms, but abhorred it as practiced on the street. “those whose minds are entirely unoccupied”, he wrote with some seriousness in 1864, “receive [street music] with satisfaction, as filling up the vacuum of time”. he calculated that 25% of his working power had been destroyed by street nuisances, many of them intentional. letters to the times and the eventual enforcement of “babbage’s act”, which would squelch street nuisances, made him the target of ridicule. babbage also worked in the fields of philosophy and code breaking, as well as campaigning for reform in british science. he died at his home in london on 18 october 1871. learn more about charles babbage and his work in the lecture of prof. doron swade from neukom institute at dartmouth college about ‘constructing charles babagge’s analytical engine‘.\\n',\n",

       " 'the bug that wasn’t really a bug – computer pioneer grace murray hopper.  the first documented computer bug in a 1947 log file © naval surface warfare center, dahlgren, va most of you might think that computers is one of these men’s business things. far from it! not even that it was a girl who was the very first programmer in history – ada augusta king countess of lovelace – it was also a woman in the early days of computers, who developed the very first compiler to translate high level language computer programs into low level machine commands. but besides her merits in computer science, we also owe the term ‘debugging’ to grace hopper, and the story goes like this…. it was on september 9 in 1947, when grace hopper was working on a mark ii computer at harvard university, which was known for its high speed electromagnetic relays. however, a moth was stuck in between the relays and after removing it, hopper taped the moth into the log book, noting that the “first actual case of bug being found.” the story of hopper’s ‘debugging‘ soon spread widely and caused that the term was from then on used for computer problems. however, the term ‘bugs’ for causing mechanical or electronic issues has a longer history and is to be attributed to the famous inventor thomas edison. in 1878, he wrote a letter to the inventor of the telephone exchange, tivadar puskás, mentioning ‘bugs’ as being responsible for his technical difficulties: “the first step [in all of my inventions] is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise – this thing gives out and [it is] then that ‘bugs’ – as such little faults and difficulties are called – show themselves” even though grace hopper was not the ‘inventor’ of the term, she did a great job distributing it widely considering computer errors, but it must be said that this was not her only achievement during her long career as a computer scientist and us navy officer. grace hopper has always been one of the curious kids, taking alarm clocks apart when she was seven and building toy vehicles she had designed by herself. after receiving her ph.d from yale university in 1934, she started teaching mathematics and joined the us navy at the age of 37. soon she was assigned to a computation project at harvard university as lieutenant, working on the mark i computer, which was a special computer due to its turing completeness (meaning that it was universally programmable). some years later, she was developing the univac i and could make major contributions in designing the computer language cobol, special due to its high dependence on the natural human language. grace hopper depicts a pioneer in computer science and was honored numerous times, for instance she ironically won the ‘computer sciences man of the year’ award in 1969. she also received the national medal of technology in 1991. at yovisto you can watch a lecture of author kurt w. beyer presenting his biography ‘grace hopper and the invention of the information age‘.  \\n',\n",
       " 'its computable - thanks to alonzo church.  you know, the fact that you can read your email on a cell phone as well as on your desktop computer or almost any other computer connected to the internet, in principle is possible thanks to mathematician alonzo church, who gave the proof (together with alan turing) that everything that is computable on the simple model of a turing machine, also is computable with any other \\'computer model\\'.  in mathematics and computer science, the \\'entscheidungsproblem\\' is one of the challenges posed by mathematician david hilbert in 1928. the entscheidungsproblem asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first order logic and answers \"yes\" or \"no\" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the underlying axioms.  actually, the origin of the entscheidungsproblem goes back to gottfried wilhelm leibniz, who in the 17th century, after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine, dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements. leibniz realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language, and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal.  by the completeness theorem of first order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the entscheidungsproblem can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic. in 1936 and 1937, alonzo church and alan turing, respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the entscheidungsproblem is impossible. to achieve this, alonzo church applied the concept of \"effective calculability\" based on his λ calculus, while alan turing based his proof on  his concept of turing machines. it was recognized immediately by turing that these two concepts are equivalent models of computation. both authors were heavily influenced by kurt gödels earlier work on his incompleteness theorem, especially by the method of assigning numbers (a so called gödel numbering) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.   alonzo church died on august 11, 1995, aged 92.  at yovisto you can learn more about alonzo church in the lecture \\'at odds with the zeitgeist: kurt gödel\\' by prof. john w. dawson from the institute of advanced studies in princeton.\\n',\n",

(in latin: calculemus!) he requested, to solve every argument or dispute. another highlight in leibniz‘ career probably was becoming the first president of the prussian academy of sciences in berlin. his achievements and contributions to the world’s development are numerous and therefore he was honored several times during his lifetime and has not been forgotten today. since a big part of his scientific work is documented in letters, the collection of these papers have been inscribed on unesco‘s memory of the world register in 2007. at yovisto, you may learn about the highlights of calculus, a lecture by professor strang, who shows how calculus applies to ordinary life situations, such as: driving a car or climbing a mountain.\\n',\n",

       " 'alfred tarski and the undefinability of truth.  alfred tarski (1901-1983). on january 14, 1902, polish american mathematician and logician alfred tarski was born. a prolific author he is best known for his work on model theory, metamathematics, and algebraic logic, he also contributed to abstract algebra, topology, geometry, measure theory, mathematical logic, set theory, and analytic philosophy. for my annual semantic web technologies lecture series i always introduce my students to model theoretic semantics as a means to enable a formal representation of meaning for languages. i guess, they don’t like the mathematical overhead. but nevertheless, you will need it to make sense of any logical expression. but, let’s get back to alfred tarski. born as alfred teitelbaum into a family of polish jews of comfortable circumstances, tarski first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at warsaw’s szkoła mazowiecka. nevertheless, he entered the university of warsaw in 1918 intending to study biology. after poland regained independence in 1918, warsaw university quickly became a world leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. famous mathematician stanisław leśniewski recognized tarski’s potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology. henceforth tarski attended courses taught by jan łukasiewicz, wacław sierpiński, and became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under leśniewski’s supervision. in 1923, alfred teitelbaum and his brother wacław changed their surname to tarski and also converted to roman catholicism, poland’s dominant religion, even though tarski was an avowed atheist. after becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at warsaw university, tarski served as łukasiewicz’s assistant. between 1923 and his departure for the united states in 1939, tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high school mathematics at warsaw secondary school, because of the small salary at warsaw university. in 1930, tarski visited the university of vienna, lectured to karl menger’s colloquium, and met kurt gödel. due to an invitation from harvard university, tarski was able to leave poland in august 1939, on the last ship to sail from poland for the united states before the german and soviet invasion of poland and the outbreak of world war ii. tarski left reluctantly, because leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which tarski hoped to fill. oblivious to the nazi threat, he left his wife and children in warsaw. he did not see them again until 1946. during the war, nearly all his extended family died at the hands of the german occupying authorities. thanks to a guggenheim fellowship, tarski visited the institute for advanced study in princeton in 1942, where he again met gödel, who also had fled from nazi germany. subsequently, he joined the mathematics department at the university of california, berkeley, where he spent the rest of his career until he became emeritus in 1968. tarski was a charismatic teacher who charmed his students, but he demanded perfection and could be devastatingly abusive to those who failed to measure up. he is recognised as one of the four greatest logicians of all time, the other three being aristotle, frege, and gödel. of these tarski was the most prolific as a logician and his collected works, excluding his books, runs to 2500 pages. tarski made important contributions in many areas of mathematics: set theory, measure theory, topology, geometry, classical and universal algebra, algebraic logic, various branches of formal logic and metamathematics. he produced axioms for ‘logical consequence‘, worked on deductive systems, the algebra of logic and the theory of definability. he can be considered a mathematical logician with exceptionally broad mathematical interests. one example of his achievements is a decision procedure for sentences written in the language of the arithmetic of real numbers. these are sentences that can be written using variables ranging over the real numbers, using symbols for the operations of addition and multiplication and for the relations of equality and order (. another great achievement was his assault on the notion of truth. tarski was able, under suitable conditions, to give a mathematically precise definition of what it means to say that a given sentence of a language is true. one of these conditions was that the syntax of the language in question be formally well defined, i.e. one could say precisely just which expressions are legitimate sentences and which not. moreover, a sentence had to have a well defined semantics, i.e. the meaning of the individual components of the sentence had to be (formally) given. now, the “metalanguage” in which this truth definition is developed is, in general, separate from the language whose true sentences are being identified. as kurt gödel previously had shown, it is possible for a language to function as its own metalanguage. but for this case, tarski was able to prove his famous “undefinability theorem“: under very general conditions, the notion of “truth” of the sentences of a language cannot be defined in that same language. thus, tarski radically transformed hilbert’s proof theoretic metamathematics. he destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics by his objection to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics at yovisto, you can learn more about the history of mathematical logics in the lecture of prof christos h. papadimitriou on the graphic novel

       " 'the steel of sir henry bessemer.  sir henry bessemer (1813 – 1898)  .  on january 19, 1813, english engineer, inventor, and businessman sir henry bessemer was born. bessemer’s name is chiefly known in connection with the bessemer process, the first process for manufacturing steel inexpensively (1856), leading to the development of the bessemer converter. henry bessemer was born on january 19, 1813 in charlton, hertfordshire, england. he was the son of an engineer and typefounder and he showed a great interest in making own inventions at early age. bessemer proved to be mechanically skilled and had his first success selling ‘gold’ powder made from brass as a paint additive. henry bessemer also patented a method for making a continuous ribbon of plate glass in 1848, but it was not really commercially successful. through the years, henry bessemer thought of more and more inventions and he began working on the problem of manufacturing cheap steel for ordnance production from 1850 to 1855 when he patented his method. he first described the process to a meeting of the british association in cheltenham which he titled “the manufacture of iron without fuel.” the famous bessemer process involved the procedure of oxygen blown in the air through molten pig iron to burn off the impurities and thus create steel. it is known that james nasmyth had been working on a similar idea for some time prior to this. however, after hearing bessemer talk about his invention, nasmyth turned his project down as he was about to retire anyway. the general lack of steel was hard for all industries back then and they had to rely on cast iron as well as wrought iron. there were several accidents when cast iron beams collapsed suddenly, such as the dee bridge disaster of may 1847, the wooton bridge collapse and the bull bridge accident of 1860. the failures continued until all cast iron under bridges were replaced by steel structures. as the cost of production steel decreased, the material was starting to be widely substituted for cast iron. when bessemer licensed the patent for his process to several ironmasters, the companies had great difficulties producing steel of an acceptable quality. the swedish ironmaster göran fredrik then tried using purer charcoal pig iron and made good steel by the process after numerous attempts. also, it had been shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese. the process highly improved the quality of the material and was first introduced by robert forester mushet. the inventor and businessman erected steelworks in sheffield in a business partnership with others and began to manufacture steel. when mushet’s daughter, mary, decided to travel to london in order to confront bessemer at his offices, arguing that his success was based on the results of her father’s work. bessemer decided to pay mushet an annual pension of £300, a very considerable sum, which he is assumed to have paid for over 20 years, possibly with the purpose to keeping the mushets from legal action.   at yovisto you may learn more about the topic in the video lecture ‘from the european coal and steel community to the common market’ by prof. dr. vernon bogdanor at gresham college.\\n',\n",
       " 'simon marius and his astronomical discoveries.  simon marius (1573-1625).  .  on january 20 (or january 10 according to the old julian calendar), 1573, german astronomer simon marius was born. marius was pupil of tycho brahe, one of the earliest users of the telescope and the first in print to make mention the andromeda nebula. he studied and named the four largest moons of jupiter that he claimed to have them discovered independently and even before galileo. simon marius was born in gunzenhausen, near nuremberg in bavaria, to reinhard marius, the mayor of gunzenhausen and his wife elisabetha. elementary for his education was the fact that, by chance, margrave georg friedrich overheard him singing. allegedly, the regent took a liking to him and arranged for him to be enrolled in the fürstenschule at heilsbronn, a protestant school for princes in the heilsbronn monastery, which marius attended until 1601 becoming its most famous ex pupil. during this period he became interested in astronomy, and his astronomical and meteorological observations began in 1594. his plan to study at königsberg couldn’t be realized, however he managed to visit famous astronomer tycho brahe at prague in 1601. there, he learned tycho brahe‘s observational techniques and instruments. brahe died that year, and marius’s stay in prague lasted only four months. but he did meet david fabricius there. being a versatile observer even at the time before the invention of the telescope, marius published his observation of the comet of 1596 and precisely established the position of the 1604 supernova in the constellation ophiuchus. in 1599 marius published a set of astronomical tables. these efforts resulted in his appointment as mathematician of the markgrafschaft of ansbach, in 1601. having heard that a telescope was being sold at the frankfurt fair in 1608, marius constructed his own. it took him about a year before he had one of sufficient quality to make astronomical observations. in the same year he published the first german translation (from the greek) of the first six books of euclid‘s elements. marius’s most memorable (and controversial) research involved the telescope: in a letter written in summer 1611 he mentions his observations of venus, and since august 1611 he had been observing sun spots, and in november of the same year he noticed that the movement of the sunspots and therefore the equatorial plane of the sun is tilted relative to the ecliptic. simon marius also observed the andromeda “nebula”, which had also been known to arab astronomers of the middle ages. of course he had no notion that he was observing a distant system of stars, because his telescope did not achieve the required resolution. in 1612 marius measured the diameter of the andromeda nebula and discerned it as having a dull, pale light which increased in brightness toward its center, like “a candle shining through horn“.   mundus iovialis anno mdcix detectus ope perspicilli belgici (the world of jupiter, 1609, detected with a flemish telescope)   in 1614 marius published his work mundus iovialis describing the planet jupiter and its moons. here he claimed to have discovered the planet’s four major moons some days before galileo galilei. this led to a dispute with galileo, who showed that marius provided only one observation as early as galileo‘s, and it matched galileo‘s diagram for the same date, as published in 1610. it is considered possible that marius discovered the moons independently, but at least some days later than galileo. regardless of priority, the mythological names by which these satellites are known today (io, europa, ganymede and callisto) are those given them by marius. he also concluded from his observations of the jovian moons that they must orbit jupiter while jupiter orbits the sun. from marius‘ observations of the jovian moons he derived better periods of revolution and other orbital elements for them than did galileo. from his observations of the jovian planetary system, marius wrongly concluded that the geocentric tychonic system, in which the planets circle the sun while the sun circles the earth, must be the correct world system. he also observed the location of tycho brahe‘s supernova of 1572 and found a star there which he estimated to be “somewhat dimmer than jupiter’s third moon.” marius drew conclusions about the structure of the universe from his observations of the jovian moons and the stellar disks. the stellar disks he observed were spurious (likely the airy disk caused by diffraction, as stars are too distant for their physical disks to be detected telescopically), but marius interpreted them to be physical disks, like the planetary disks visible through a telescope. he concluded that since he could see stellar disks, the stars could not be as distant as was required in the copernican world system, and he said that the appearance of the stars as seen through a telescope actually argued against copernicus. simon marius died in ansbach after a brief illness in 1624. at yovisto, you can learn more about the power of scientific ideas, as well about their failure. science is a perpetual search for new ideas, but this says nothing of how correct it is. gresham college prof ian angell introduces you to ‘science’s first

       " 'pierre gassendi and his trials to reconcile epicurean atomism with christianity.  pierre gassendi (1592-1655). you have read the title? i guess, you might be scared now, but pierre gassendi was a decent fellow… on january 22, 1592, french philosopher, priest, scientist, astronomer, and mathematician. pierre gassendi was born. gassendi revived epicureanism as a substitute for aristotelianism, attempting in the process to reconcile atomism‘s mechanistic explanation of nature with christian belief in immortality, free will, an infinite god, and creation.he clashed with his contemporary descartes on the possibility of certain knowledge. he was also an active observational scientist, publishing the first data on the transit of mercury in 1631. pierre gassendi was born at champtercier, near digne, in france to antoine gassend and françoise fabry, a family of commoners. already at a very early age he showed academic potential and attended the college at digne, where he displayed a particular aptitude for languages and mathematics. at age 16, he entered the university of aix en provence, to study philosophy. in 1612 the college of digne called him to lecture on theology. four years later he received the degree of doctor of theology at avignon, and in 1617 he took holy orders. in the same year he answered a call to the chair of philosophy at aix en provence university, and seems gradually to have withdrawn from theology. pierre gassendi‘s career as a priest is a crucial facet of his intellectual constitution: his writings reflect an unbending allegiance to holy scripture and church teachings, though not necessarily in orthodox doctrinal lights. he was ordained at the age of 24 or 25 and, while there is no question of the strength of his faith, one motivation for his career in the church appears to be its provision of a sinecure.  he lectured principally on the aristotelian philosophy, conforming as far as possible to the traditional methods while he also followed with interest the discoveries of galileo and kepler. he came into contact with the astronomer joseph gaultier de la vallette (1564–1647). in 1623 the society of jesus took over the university of aix. they filled all positions with jesuits, who disapproved of gassendi’s anti aristotelianism, and compelled him to leave. he left, returning to digne, and then travelled for the chapter to grenoble. in 1624 he printed the first part of his exercitationes paradoxicae adversus aristoteleos (paradoxical exercises against the aristotelians). pierre gassendi thereafter engaged in many scientific studies with his patron, nicolas claude fabri de peiresc, until the latter’s death in 1637, which seemed to afflict him deeply. gassendi travelled in flanders and in holland, and returned to france in 1631, and two years later became provost of digne cathedral. during this time he wrote some works, at the insistence of theologian and mathematician marin mersenne. they included his examination of the mystical philosophy of robert fludd, an essay on parhelia, and some observations on the transit of mercury. in 1641, he met thomas hobbes in paris, where gassendi also gave some informal philosophy classes, which according to the biographer grimarest included molière and cyrano de bergerac . in 1642 mersenne engaged gassendi and other eminent thinkers in controversy with rené descartes to contribute a commentary on the manuscript of rené descartes’s meditations. this led to gassendi’s objections to the fundamental propositions of descartes published as the fifth set of objections in the works of descartes. in 1645 gassendi was appointed professor of mathematics at the collège royal in paris, and lectured for several years with great success. in addition to controversial writings on physical questions, there appeared during this period the first of the works for which historians of philosophy remember him. gassendi attempted to find what he called a middle way between skepticism and dogmatism. he argued that, while metaphysical knowledge of the “essences” (inner natures) of things is impossible, by relying on induction and the information provided by “appearances” one can acquire probable knowledge of the natural world that is sufficient to explain and predict experience. the best theory of such a world, in gassendi’s opinion, is the ancient atomism according to epicurus. there, atoms are eternal, differently shaped, and moving at different speeds. gassendi argued that such atoms must have some of the physical features of the visible objects they constitute, such as extension, size, shape, weight, and solidity. the atoms collide and agglomerate, resulting in events in the perceptible world. in 1647 he published the well received treatise de vita, moribus, et doctrina epicuri libri octo followed by further publications on diogenes laërtius and another commentary on epicurus. gassendi believed that there was no conflict between his mechanistic atomism and the doctrines of roman catholicism; indeed, he took pains to emphasize their compatibility. in 1648 ill health compelled him to give up his lectures at the collège royal. he travelled in the south of france and spent nearly two years at toulon, where the climate suited him. in 1653 he returned to paris and resumed his literary work publishing lives of copernicus and of tycho brahe. he died at paris in 1655 from a lung disease. at yovisto, you may enjoy a video lecture by dr. richard brown on rene descartes‘ method of doubt.\\n',\n",

       " 'thomas willis and the royal society.  thomas willis (1621-1675). on january 27, 1620, english physician and founding member of the royal society thomas willis who played an important part in the history of anatomy, neurology and psychiatry. a club of scientists including robert boyle, christopher wren and john wilkins met in his rooms in oxford, which later should become founding members of the royal society. thomas willis was born the eldest of three sons on his parents‘ small farm in great bedwyn, wiltshire, where his father (also) thomas willis held the stewardship of the manor. he was a kinsman of the willys baronets of fen ditton, cambridgeshire and a staunch royalist, and both willis and his father would later serve in the civil war, though willis’ father would not survive. willis went to oxford as a servitor and graduated  from christ church, oxford in 1642. in the civil war years he was a royalist, dispossessed of the family farm at north hinksey by parliamentary forces. willis started in oxford intending to follow a career in the church. when the civil war made that appear chancy, he turned to medicine. meanwhile, willis served king charles i in the ongoing civil war in the auxiliary regiment of the earl of dover. in the 1640s willis was one of the royal physicians to charles i of england. while it is unclear whether or not he actually participated in any battles, willis’ loyalty and service to the king was rewarded by the early conferral of his medical degree, despite the fact he was seven years away from graduating from the fourteen year program. less grandly, once qualified b. med. in 1646, he began as an active physician by regularly attending the market at abingdon. willis’ breakthrough as a physician came about with the revival of anne green on december 14, 1650. green, a 22 year old servant, was a prisoner of the state who was convicted of the infanticide of her newborn child, and was sentenced to be hanged. at the time, obtaining corpses for anatomical dissection was difficult, so the bodies of executed individuals were typically donated to universities. after being hanged in oxford’s cattle yard, green’s body was donated for scientific study to oxford. thus, green was delivered to the home of william petty, a colleague of willis’ and a lecturer in anatomy at oxford. when the coffin was opened, an audible gagging was heard and green started to breath. together petty and willis resuscitated the ‘corpse’, using unorthodox but ultimately successful techniques. while in oxford, willis made his chambers available for anglican services during the puritan interregnum. one of several oxford cliques of those interested in science grew up around willis and christ church. besides robert hooke, who would become willis’s leading rival, and who both politically and medically held some incompatible views, others in the group were nathaniel hodges, john locke, richard lower, henry stubbe and john ward. in the broader oxford scene, he was a colleague in the “oxford club” of experimentalists with ralph bathurst, robert boyle, william petty, john wilkins and christopher wren.   frontispiece to thomas willis’ 1663 book “diatribae duae medico philosophicae – quarum prior agit de fermentatione”   in 1656 and 1659 willis published two significant medical works, de fermentatione and de febribus. these were followed by the 1664 volume on the brain, cerebri anatome, cui accessit nervorum descriptio et usus )anatomy of the brain, with a description of the nerves and their function), which was a record of collaborative experimental work closely with christopher wren and richard lower, who contributed drawings and assisted with dissections. cerebri anatome is considered the most complete and accurate account of the nervous system to that time. willis is credited with coining the term neurology, which first appears in cerebri anatome. willis was the first to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually enumerated by anatomists. the cerebri anatome was the main reason why the arterial circle found at the base of the human brain is now called the circle of willis. though he was not the first one who discovered and described it, he was the only one who was able to discuss it in great detail, describing each part and vascular pattern in depth. willis therefore is regarded by modern physicians and anatomists as the founder of clinical neuroscience, neurology, comparative anatomy, and neuroanatomy. in addition, he made significant original contributions to cardiology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology. willis coined the term mellitus in diabetes mellitus. an old name for the condition is “willis’s disease“. he observed what had been known for many centuries elsewhere, that the urine is sweet in patients. his observations on diabetes formed a chapter of pharmaceutice rationalis (1674). further research came from johann conrad brunner, who had met willis in london. from 1660 until his death, he was sedleian professor of natural philosophy at oxford. at the time of the formation of the royal society of london, he was on the 1660 list of priority candidates, and became a fellow in 1661. henry stubbe became a polemical opponent of the society, and used his knowledge of willis’s earlier work before 1660 to belittle some of the claims made by its proponents. willis later worked as a physician in westminster, london, this coming about after he treated gilbert sheldon in 1666. thomas willis died on st. martin‘s day, 11 november 1675, in london.   at yovisto, you may enjoy a more detailed explanation on the founding of the royal society by professor michael hunter at gresham college.\\n',\n",
       " 'ernst kummer and his achievements in mathematics.  ernst eduard kummer (1810-1893). on january 29, 1810, german mathematician ernst eduard kummer was born. one of his major contributions is the introduction of ideal numbers, which are defined as a special subgroup of a ring, extended the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to complex number fields.he also discovered the fourth order surface based on the singular surface of the quadratic line complex. this kummer surface has 16 isolated conical double points and 16 singular tangent planes. ernst kummer was born in sorau, brandenburg (then part of prussia)to his father carl gotthelf kummer, a physician. however his father died when ernst was only three years old and ernst and his elder brother karl were brought up by their mother. ernst received private coaching before entering the gymnasium in sorau when he was nine years old. in 1828 kummer entered the university of halle to study protestant theology. but fortunately for the good of mathematics, kummer received mathematics teaching as part of his degree to provide a proper foundation to the study of philosophy. soon the study of mathematics should become his main subject, although at this stage he still saw it as leading to a later study of philosophy. in 1831 kummer was awarded a prize for a mathematical essay and in the same year he was awarded his certificate to enable him to teach in schools. moreover, on the strength of his prize winning essay, he was awarded a doctorate. after a probationary year at the gymnasium in sorau where he had been educated, he was appointed to a teaching post at the gymnasium in liegnitz, now legnica in poland that he held for the next 10 years. some of his pupils there had great ability, most prominent among them leopold kronecker, and conversely they were extremely fortunate to find a school teacher of kummer‘s quality and ability to inspire. during kummer‘s first period of mathematics he worked on function theory. he extended gauss‘s work on hypergeometric series, giving developments that are useful in the theory of differential equations. he was the first to compute the monodromy groups of these series. in 1839, although still a school teacher, kummer was elected to the berlin academy on dirichlet‘s recommendation. in 1842, kummer became professor of mathematics at the university of breslau (now wrocław, poland). in 1855 he succeeded peter gustav lejeune dirichlet as professor of mathematics at the university of berlin, at the same time also becoming a professor at the berlin war college. in 1843, kummer showed dirichlet an attempted proof of fermat’s last theorem. but, dirichlet found an error, and kummer continued his search and developed the concept of so called ideal numbers. in number theory an ideal number is an algebraic integer which represents an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field. an ideal is a special subset of an algebraic ring. ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers, such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3. addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number. using the concept of ideal numbers, kummer proved the insolubility of the fermat relation for all but a small group of primes, and he thus laid the foundation for an eventual complete proof of fermat’s last theorem. for his great advance, the french academy of sciences awarded him its grand prize in 1857. the ideal numbers have made possible new developments in the arithmetic of algebraic numbers. in 1861, germany’s first seminar in pure mathematics was established at berlin on the recommendation of kummer and karl weierstrass. it soon attracted gifted young mathematicians form throughout the world, including many graduate students. kummer’s berlin lectures, always carefully prepared, covered analytic geometry, mechanics, the theory of surfaces, and number theory. for the rest of his life, kummer was devoted to geometry. he applied himself with unbroken productivity to ray systems and also considered ballistic problems. by that time, also discovered the fourth order surface, now named after him, based on the singular surface of the quadratic line complex. the kummer surface has 16 isolated conical double points and 16 singular tangent planes and was published in 1864. he retired at his own request in 1883 to spent the last years of his life in quiet retirement until his death in 1893. at yovisto, you can learn more about number theoryin a lecture on gauss’ law.\\n',\n",

       " 'euclid – the father of geometry.  euclid of alexandria, fl. 300 bc at about 330 bc, euclid of alexandria was born, who often is referred to as the father of geometry. his elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. in the elements, euclid deduced the principles of what is now called euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. very few original references to euclid survive, so little is known about his life. the date, place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other figures mentioned alongside him. the few historical references to euclid were written long after he lived, by proclus c. 450 ad and pappus of alexandria c. 320 ad. proclus introduces euclid only briefly in his commentary on the elements. according to proclus, euclid belonged to plato‘s “persuasion” and brought together the elements, drawing on prior work by several pupils of plato. proclus believes that euclid must have lived during the time of ptolemy i because he was mentioned by archimedes, who refers to him as the author of the elements. proclus later retells a story that, when ptolemy i asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than euclid’s elements, “euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.” this anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about menaechmus and alexander the great. arabian authors state that euclid was the son of naucrates and that he was born in tyre. it is believed by historians of mathematics that this is entirely fictitious and was merely invented by the authors. because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period, some researchers have proposed that euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name euclid from a historical figure. they think, euclid might be similar to bourbaki, the collective pseudonym under which a group of 20th century mathematicians published with the aim of reformulating mathematics. however, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor. one of the oldest surviving fragments of euclid’s elements, found at oxyrhynchus and dated to circa ad 100   euclid‘s most famous work is his treatise on mathematics the elements. the book was a compilation of knowledge that became the centre of mathematical teaching for 2000 years. probably no results in the elements were first proved by euclid but the organisation of the material and its exposition are certainly due to him. one of euclid‘s accomplishments was to present the material in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later. there is no mention of euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the elements, and most of the copies say they are “from the edition of theon” or the “lectures of theon“. the only reference that historians rely on of euclid having written the elements actually was from proclus, who briefly in his commentary on the elements ascribes euclid as its author. in his elements, euclic put the mathematical knowledge of his age on a solid foundation. he began in book i with 23 definitions, such as “a point is that which has no part” and “a line is a length without breadth”, followed by five unproved assumptions that he called postulates (now known as axioms). euclid stated that axioms were statements that were just believed to be true, but he realized that by blindly following statements, there would be no point in devising mathematical theories and formulae. he realized that even axioms had to be backed with solid proofs. the elements is divided into 13 books. books one to six deal with plane geometry. in particular books one and two set out basic properties of triangles, parallels, parallelograms, rectangles and squares. book three studies properties of the circle while book four deals with problems about circles and is thought largely to set out work of the followers of pythagoras. book five lays out the work of eudoxus on proportion applied to commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes. book six looks at applications of the results of book five to plane geometry. although best known for its geometric results, the elements also includes number theory, which he presented in book seven to nine. it considers the connection between perfect numbers and mersenne primes (known as the euclid–euler theorem), the infinitude of prime numbers, euclid‘s lemma on factorization (which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations), and the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. the geometrical system described in the elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. today, however, that system is often referred to as euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so called non euclidean geometries that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century. book ten deals with the theory of irrational numbers and is mainly the work of theaetetus. books eleven to thirteen deal with three dimensional geometry, in greek stereometria. the immense impact of the elements on islamic mathematics is visible through the many translations into arabic from the 9th century forward. euclid first became known in europe through latin translations of these versions. the first extant latin translation of the elements was made about 1120 by adelard of bath, who obtained a copy of an arabic version in spain, where he traveled while disguised as a muslim student. more than one thousand editions of the elements have been published since it was first printed in 1482. the impact of this activity on european mathematics cannot be overestimated. the ideas and methods of johannes kepler, pierre de fermat, rené descartes, and isaac newton were deeply rooted in, and inconceivable without, euclid’s elements. at yovisto, you can learn more about non euclidian geometry in the history of mathematics

       " 'dmitri mendeleev and the periodic table of elements.  dmitri mendeleev (1834 – 1907).  on february 2, 1907, russian chemist and inventor dmitri ivanovich mendeleev passed away. he is probably best known for his version of the periodic table of chemical elements. furthermore, he used it to correct the properties of some already discovered elements and also to predict the properties of eight elements yet to be discovered. dmitri mendeleev was born in tobolsk, siberia and moved to saint petersburg where he was able to enroll at the same institution his father attended, the main pedalogical institute. mendeleev trained to become a teacher while publishing several research papers. even though it is believed that mendeleev was due to his temper quite unpopular, he graduated as one of the best students of his class. he was awarded the master’s degree in chemistry around 1856.  mendeleev won an award to pursue chemical research in europe and spent some time at the university of heidelberg, where he worked with robert bunsen. in 1860, bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered cesium using chemical spectroscopy, which they introduced to mendeleev as well. in the same year, dmitri mendeleev attended the first known international chemistry conference at karlsruhe, which was used to discuss standadization methods in chemistry and therefore great use for mendeleev’s future worok on the periodic table. back in russia, mendeleev saw the need to improve russian language chemistry textbooks and it has been handed down, that the scientist wrote a 500page textbook in just 60 days called ‘organic chemistry’. the work not only improved the education of chemistry in russia but also increased mendeleev’s reputation dramatically. he became the chair of general chemistry at the university of saint petersburg at the age of 33. another major work by mendeleev in this period, published in 1869, was the ‘principles of chemistry’ which was translated into english, french, and german.  even though other scientists including john newlands, alexandre béguyer de chancourtois, and julius lothar meyer made important contributions to the periodic table, the main credit goes to dmitri mendeleev. according to the royal society of chemistry, there were two problems regarding the establishment of a pattern for the elements. back then, only 60 elements were discovered and as we know today, parts of their information was wrong. at first, the scientist wrote the elements’ properties on cards and he realized that when arranging the elements in order of increasing atomic weight, certain element types occurred regularly. mendeleev’s‘s ideas were presented to the russian physico chemical society and published in the main german chemistry periodical of the time, zeitschrift für chemie. from the arrangement in the table, mendeleev noticed that sometimes the atomic weights must be wrong, because the elements appeared at the wrong places. today, we know that it is the atomic number, not relative atomic mass that decides an element’s position in the periodic table. however, in most cases they result in the same order. at yovisto you may learn more about ‘dmitri mendeleev & lothar meyer – the periodic table’.\\n',\n",
       " 'charles lindbergh and his spirit of st. louis.  charles lindbergh.  on february 4, 1902, american aviator, author, inventor, explorer, and social activist charles lindbergh was born. as a 25-year old  air mail pilot, lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his orteig prize winning solo nonstop flight from new york to paris, france in the single seat, single engine purpose built ryan monoplane spirit of st. louis. charles lindbergh was born in detroit to a lawyer and a chemistry teacher. it is believed that lindbergh was fascinated by aviation from early age and his enthusiasm increased during his engineering studies at the university of wisconsin in madison, where he started in 1920. lindbergh entered a lincoln, nebraska flying school in 1922 and first served as a mechanic, wingwalker, and parachute jumper. it is believed that his first solo flight was accomplished about one year later. charles lindbergh managed to graduate first in his class at the  army flying school, san antonio and became the first air mail pilot between chicago and st. louis. already in 1919, the new york hotel businessman raymond orteig offered $25.000 for the first non stop flight between new york and paris, and lindbergh decided to challenge a group of businessmen in st. louis to back him in an attempt to win the prize. the plane was named spirit of st. louis and was designed and constructed with lindbergh’s help by ryan airlines of san diego. in may 1927, charles lindbergh took off from new york city to france’s capital city. it is believed that he packed only a few sandwiches, water and most importantly maps and charts. lindbergh refused to take a parachute and radio with him in order to save fuel. the spirit of st. louis was a single engine monoplane and most people believed it not to be capable of crossing the  atlantic ocean, as most long distance pilots favored multi engine planes. however, after 33.5 hours and 3600 miles, charles lindbergh set his plane down at le bourget field near paris. the pilot’s fame came almost instantly. he received the congressional medal of honor, was congratulated by many countries, and made a  tour in the spirit of st. louis to promote the commercialization of aviation after his heroic flight. he also made several trips to latin american countries to promote aviation and met his future wife anne morrow, the daughter of the american ambassador. of course, he taught his wife how to fly and she became the first known american woman to earn the glider pilot’s license. she became not only lindbergh’s partner in life but also his co pilot, radio operator and navigator. it is further assumed that lindbergh was responsible for inspecting the status of aviation in european countries and he convinced the  government to strengthen their air capability due to germany’s increasing air power. however, he did not support the entry of the  into the european war. after the attack on pearl harbor, lindbergh served as a technical advisor as well as test pilot for united aircraft. during his active years in aviation, lindbergh also chaired the national advisory committee for aeronautics and authored several books, which are also considered successful. the spirit of st. louis was probably his most successful work. the autobiographical by charles lindbergh focused on the events leading up to and including his 1927 solo trans atlantic flight in the spirit of st. louis. it was published in 1953, and won a pulitzer prize one year later. at yovisto you may learn more about lindbergh’s flight and return.\\n',\n",
       " 'joseph priestley and the discovery of oxygen.  equipment used by joseph priestley in his experiments on gases.  on february 6, 1804, english theologian, dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, chemist, educator, and liberal political theorist joseph priestley passed away. being a rather prolific author with more than 150 works published, he is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although carl wilhelm scheele and antoine lavoisier also have a claim to the discovery. joseph priestley attended local schools and learned greek, latin, and hebrew because he was intended for the ministry. later on, priestley also studied languages including french, italian, and german as well as aramic and arabic. also, he was introduced to mathematics, natural philosophy, logic, and metaphysics through the works of isaac watts, willem’s  gravesande, and john locke. priestley was educated at daventry, a dissenting academy and spent most of his life employed as a preacher or teacher. however, he gradually came to question the divinity of jesus, while accepting much else of christianity—in the process becoming an early unitarian.  ‘the history of electricity‘ was priestley’s first known scientific work and for this achievement, he was made fellow of the royal society. it is believed that he had been inspired by benjamin franklin, whom he met in london. priestley began performing experiments in order to reproduce those reported in scientific works, and later on he started answering some questions on his own. priestley became interested in the research of nature and gases. since he was living next to a brewery, priestley was able to obtain a great supply of carbon dioxide. in his first known publication on the topic, joseph priestley described how to carbonate water, in imitation of some naturally occurring bubbly mineral waters. probably inspired by the works of stephen hales. priestley started examining the ‘airs’ that may be released from different substances. he managed to isolate and characterize about eight gases including oxygen. priestley is also credited with important contributions to the understanding of photosynthesis. he proved that plants somehow change the composition of the air. in one of his famous experiments, priestley kept a mouse in a jar of air until it collapsed and he found out that a mouse that was kept with a plant would survive. he developed the hypothesis that plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. [2, 3] one of priestley’s most famous experiment was performed in 1774. he used a 12-inch wide glass “burning lens” and focused sunlight on a lump of reddish mercuric oxide in an inverted glass container placed in a pool of mercury. as a result, the gas emitted and he found it “five or six times as good as common air”. after further tests, priestley called his discovery “dephlogisticated air“. he explained that it supported combustion so well because it had no phlogiston in it, and hence could absorb the maximum amount during burning. however, the swedish apothecary carl wilhelm scheele isolated the same gas and observed a similar reaction. scheele called his material “fire air” but he did not publish his findings until 1777.  at yovisto, you may enjoy a video lecture by professor mcbride called “oxygen and the chemical revolution” at yale university in 2008.\\n',\n",
       " 'alfred adler and the individual psychology.  alfred adler (1870-1937).  .  on february 7, 1870, austrian psychiatrist and ophthalmologist alfred w. adler was born. he is best known for being the founder of the school of individual psychology. alfred adler considered human beings as an individual whole, therefore he called his psychology “individual psychology“. moreover, adler also was the first to emphasize the importance of the social element in the re adjustment process of the individual and who carried psychiatry into the community. alfred adler was born in rudolfsheim, in the suburbs of vienna, as third of the seven children of a hungarian born, jewish grain merchant and his wife. at the age of four, alfred developed pneumonia and heard a doctor say to his father, “your boy is lost”. at that point, he decided to become a physician. he was very interested in the subjects of psychology, sociology as well as philosophy. after studying at university of vienna, he recieived a medical degree in 1895. first he specialized as an eye doctor, and later in neurology and psychiatry. he established his office across from the prater, the famous e amusement park and circus in the lower class part of vienna. most his clients were circus performers. he studied their unusual strengths and weaknesses, and this gave him insights on his organ inferiority theory. in 1902 adler received an invitation from sigmund freud to join an informal discussion group, the “wednesday society” (mittwochsgesellschaft), which met regularly on wednesday evenings at freud’s home and was the beginning of the psychoanalytic movement. a long serving member of the group, in 1910 adler became president of the vienna psychoanalytic society. he remained a member of the society until 1911, when he and a group of his supporters formally disengaged from freud’s circle, the first of the great dissenters from orthodox psychoanalysis, preceding carl jung’s split in 1914. this departure suited both freud and adler, since they had grown to dislike each other. while adler is often referred to as a “a pupil of freud’s“, in fact this was never true; they were colleagues. adler founded the society for individual psychology in 1912 after his break from the psychoanalytic movement. their enmity aside, adler retained a lifelong admiration for freud’s ideas on dreams and credited him with creating a scientific approach to their clinical utilization. nevertheless, even regarding dream interpretation, adler had his own theoretical and clinical approach. the primary differences between adler and freud centered on adler’s contention that the social realm (exteriority) is as important to psychology as is the internal realm (interiority). the dynamics of power and compensation extend beyond sexuality, and gender and politics can be as important as libido. freud also did not share adler’s socialist beliefs. adler enjoyed considerable success and celebrity in building an independent school of psychotherapy and a unique personality theory. he traveled and lectured for a period of 25 years promoting his socially oriented approach. his intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well being with that of social equality. adler’s efforts were halted by world war i, during which he served as a doctor with the austrian army. from 1921 onwards, adler was a frequent lecturer in europe and the united states, becoming a visiting professor at columbia university in 1927.   adler was concerned with the overcoming of the superiority/inferiority dynamic and was one of the first psychotherapists to discard the analytic couch in favor of two chairs. this allows the clinician and patient to sit together more or less as equals. adler argued for holism, viewing the individual holistically rather than reductively, the latter being the dominant lens for viewing human psychology. adler was also among the first in psychology to argue in favor of feminism, and the female analyst, making the case that power dynamics between men and women are crucial to understanding human psychology. in the early 1930s, after most of adler’s austrian clinics had been closed due to his jewish heritage, adler left austria for a professorship at the long island college of medicine in the usa. in 1937, adler went on a lecture tour and suffered a fatal heart attack in aberdeen, scotland.   around the world there are various organizations promoting adler’s orientation towards mental and social well being. these include the international committee of adlerian summer schools and institutes (icassi), the north american society for adlerian psychology (nasap) and the international association for individual psychology. teaching institutes and programs exist in austria, canada, england, germany, greece, israel, italy, japan, latvia, switzerland, the united states, jamaica, peru, and wales. adler left behind many theories and practices that very much influenced the world of psychiatry. today these concepts are known as adlerian psychology. at yovisto, dr. paul bloom of yale university in his 2007 course on ‘introduction to psychology’ introduces the students to the theories of sigmund freud, including a brief biographical description and his contributions to the field of psychology. the limitations of his theories of psychoanalysis are covered in detail, as well as the ways in which his conception of the unconscious mind still operate in mainstream psychology today.\\n',\n",
       " 'erich von drygalski’s antarctic expeditions.  erich von drygalski (1865-1949).  .  on february 9, 1865, german geographer, geophysicist and polar scientist erich dagobert von drygalski was born. drygalski discovered a volcano, free of ice, on the antarctic continent. he named it gaussberg, after the name of his research ship gauss in which he led the german south polar expedition (1901-03). erich von drygalski was born in köningsberg, east prussia. at age 17, drygalski began to study mathematics and natural science at the university of königsberg, but soon went to bonn in order to attend the lectures of ferdinand von richthofen, whom he followed in 1883 to leipzig and in 1886 to berlin. he graduated with a doctorate thesis about ice shields in nordic areas. between 1888 and 1891, he was an assistant at the geodetic institute and the central office of international geodetics in berlin. he habilitated 1889 for geography and geophysics with the collected scientific evidence. in 1898, drygalski became associate professor and 1899 extraordinary professor for geography and geophysics in berlin. near the end of the nineteenth century ‘antarctic fever’ broke out in western europe and the summer of 1891 and in 1892–1893 drygalsky led the preliminary and main expeditions of the berlin geographical society to western greenland. one expedition wintered during the winter between 1892 and 1893 in western greenland. this expedition established drygalski’s international reputation. in 1898 the german south polar commission suggested a national expedition to antarctica, which was tirelessly advocated and supported by georg von neumayer. as professor of geography and geophysics at the university of berlin, drygalski was subsequently chosen to be the leader of the expedition. financing was not an issue but the commission felt one ship would be all that was necessary so drygalski asked for and received permission to build a new vessel – the gauss – rather than modify an existing ship.   the gauss enclosed in the ice. photo taken from a balloon, the first aerial photography in antarctica   on august 11, 1901, the gauss left kiel for the south with a crew of 32 men, among them also 5 scientists including drygalsky. its goal was to explore the unknown area of antarctica lying south of the kerguelen islands. a small party of the expedition was also stationed on the kerguelen islands, where they arrived in early january 1902, while the main party proceeded further south. gauss was carrying a balloon which allowed drygalski to become the first man to fly over the antarctic. drygalski also paid a brief call to heard island and provided the first comprehensive scientific information on the island’s geology, flora and fauna. despite being trapped by ice at latitude 66° 5′ for nearly fourteen months until february 1903, the expedition discovered new territory in antarctica, the kaiser wilhelm ii land with the gaussberg. after returning cape town, south africa, on june 9, 1903, drygalski asked for a new expedition to the german government, but it was denied, so the crew put heading to germany. emperor wilhelm ii complained that the gauss had only reached 66° 5′, while a british expedition already proceeded up to 82° 17′. upon arrival to kiel on 23 november, drygalski was found with frustration that his expedition not was sufficiently valued, although he would still feel really satisfied. after his return, drygalsky refused to take part in the “race to the south pole” and concentrated of his scientific publications. although the expedition’s report appeared soon after its return (zum kontinent des eisigen südens, 1904), the scientific conclusions were fully developed only after almost thirty years of indefatigable labor by drygalski and his co workers. between 1905 and 1931, he published twenty volumes and two atlases documenting the expedition. in 1906 he accepted a call to the newly established chair of geography at the university of munich, which he made highly regarded and held until his retirement in 1935. he also presided the geographic institute, founded by him, until his death. in 1910, he also took part in count ferdinand von zeppelin’s expedition to spitsbergen and participated in other expeditions to north america and northeastern asia. in 1933, the royal geographical society awarded drygalsky with the patron’s medal. erich von drygalsky died 1949 in munich. at yovisto, you may learn more about the heroic age of antarctic exploration by edward larson.  \\n',\n",
       " 'leo szilard and the atomic bomb.  leó szilárd (1898–1964)  .  on february 11, 1898, hungarian american physicist and inventor leo szilárd was born. he conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, patented the idea of a nuclear reactor with enrico fermi, and in late 1939 together with albert einstein wrote the letter that resulted in the manhattan project that built the atomic bomb. he also conceived the electron microscope, the linear accelerator, and also the cyclotron. szilárd was born in budapest, hungary, as son of louis spitz, a jewish civil engineer, and thekla vidor . already while attending high school, leo showed an early interest in physics and a proficiency in mathematics. in 1916, he enrolled as an engineering student at budapest technical university. the following year he was drafted, but before his regiment was sent to the front lines, szilárd fell ill with spanish influenza and he was returned home for hospitalization. in 1919 he resumed engineering studies at budapest technical university but soon decided to leave hungary due to the chaotic political situation and continued engineering studies at technische hochschule (institute of technology) in berlin charlottenburg. he soon changed to physics there and took physics classes from albert einstein, max planck, and max von laue. with his dissertation on thermodynamics über die thermodynamischen schwankungserscheinungen (on the manifestation of thermodynamic fluctuations), praised by einstein, he was awarded a doctorate in physics from humboldt university of berlin in 1922 . he was appointed as assistant to max von laue at the university of berlin’s institute for theoretical physics in 1924 , where he finished his habilitation in 1927 to become a privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. throughout his time in berlin he worked on numerous technical inventions. in 1928 he submitted a patent application for the linear accelerator and, in 1929, he applied for a patent for the cyclotron. szilárd’s 1929 paper, “über die entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen system bei eingriffen intelligenter wesen” (on the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), introduced the thought experiment now called szilárd’s engine and became important in the history of attempts to understand maxwell’s demon. this work also is the first equation of negative entropy and information. szilárd went to london in 1933 where he read an article where ernest rutherford rejected the feasibility of using atomic energy for practical purposes. rutherford remarked specifically on the recent 1932 work of his students, john cockcroft and ernest walton, in “splitting” lithium into alpha particles, by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. although the atom had been split and energy released, nuclear fission had not yet been discovered. szilárd was reportedly so annoyed at rutherford’s dismissal that he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. the idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not then known, but szilárd realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self sustaining. the following year he filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron induced nuclear chain reaction. in 1938 szilárd accepted an offer to conduct research at columbia university in manhattan, and moved to new york. after learning about the successful nuclear fission experiment conducted in 1939 in germany by otto hahn, fritz strassmann and lise meitner, leo szilárd and enrico fermi concluded that uranium would be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction. szilárd and fermi conducted a simple experiment at columbia and discovered significant neutron multiplication in uranium, proving that the chain reaction was possible and enabling nuclear weapons. at around that time the germans and others were in a race to produce a nuclear chain reaction. german attempts to control the chain reaction sought to do so using graphite, but these attempts proved unsuccessful. szilárd realized graphite was indeed perfect for controlling chain reactions, and fostered by his attempts, the first human controlled chain reaction occurred on december 2, 1942. szilárd was directly responsible for the creation of the manhattan project. in august 1939, together with his old friend albert einstein he drafted a confidential letter to franklin d. roosevelt explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, warning of nazi work on such weapons and encouraging the development of a program which could result in their creation . the einstein–szilárd letter resulted in the creation of the manhattan project. szilárd relocated to the university of chicago to continue work on the project. as the war continued, szilárd became increasingly dismayed that scientists were losing control of their research to the military. his resentment towards the  government was exacerbated by his failure to prevent the destructive use of the atomic bomb through having a test explosion that could be witnessed by japanese observers who would then have the opportunity to surrender and spare lives. however, the new  president harry truman agreed with advisers and chose to use atomic bombs against hiroshima and nagasaki over the protestations of szilárd and other scientists. in 1947, szilárd switched his field of study from physics to molecular biology. there, he gave essential advice to theodore puck and philip i. marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955. in february 1950 szilárd publicly warned of the possibility of a so called cobalt bomb, a new kind of nuclear weapon using cobalt as a tamper, designed to produce enhanced amounts of radioactive fallout to contaminate a large area with radioactive material. szilárd suggested that an arsenal of cobalt bombs would be capable of destroying all human life on earth . in 1961 szilárd published a book of short stories, the voice of the dolphins, in which he dealt with the moral and ethical issues raised by the cold war and his own role in the development of atomic weapons. in 1960, szilárd was diagnosed with bladder cancer. he spent his last years as a fellow of the salk institute in san diego until his death in may 1964. at yovisto, you may enjoy a short video lecture by tyler dewitt on the ‘atomic structure: discovery of the neutron‘   acknowledgment: we would like

       " 'lejeune dirichlet and the mathematical function.  peter gustav lejeune dirichlet (1805-1859). on february 13, 1805, german mathematician johann peter gustav lejeune dirichlet was born. dirichlet is best known for his papers on conditions for the convergence of trigonometric series and the use of the series to represent arbitrary functions. he also proposed in 1837 the modern definition of a mathematical function.   gustav lejeune dirichlet was born in düren, halfway between aachen and cologne in germany, a town on the left bank of the rhine which at the time was part of napoleon bonaparte’s french empire. his father johann arnold lejeune dirichlet was the postmaster, merchant, and city councilor, whose family came from richelet, a small town in belgium. this explains the origin of his name which comes from “le jeune de richelet” meaning “young from richelet”. the youngest of seven children, his parents enrolled him in an elementary school and then private school to become a merchant. but, young dirichlet showed a strong interest in mathematics and convinced his parents to allow him to continue his studies. in 1817 he was sent to the gymnasium in bonn and in 1820, dirichlet moved to the jesuit gymnasium in cologne, where his lessons with georg simon ohm widened his knowledge in mathematics. by the age of 16 dirichlet had completed his school qualifications and was ready to enter university. however, the standards in german universities were not high at this time so dirichlet decided to study in paris. in 1822, dirichlet contracted smallpox, but it did not keep him away from his lectures in the collège de france for long. in 1823 he was recommended to general foy, who hired him as a private tutor to teach his children german, the wage finally allowing dirichlet to become independent from his parents’ financial support. dirichlet’s first original research brought him immediate fame, since it was on fermat’s last theorem. the theorem claimed that for n > 2 there are no non zero integers x, y, z such that xn + yn = zn. the cases n = 3 and n = 4 had been proven by leonard euler and fermat, and dirichlet attacked the theorem for n = 5. adrien marie legendre, one of the referees, soon completed the proof for this case, while dirichlet completed his own proof a short time after legendre, and a few years later produced a full proof for the case n=14. in 1825, encouraged by alexander von humboldt, dirichlet decided to return to germany. in order to teach in a german university dirichlet would have needed an habilitation. although dirichlet could easily submit an habilitation thesis, this was not allowed since he did not hold a doctorate, nor could he speak latin, as it was required by that time. the problem was nicely solved by the university of cologne giving dirichlet an honorary doctorate, thus allowing him to submit his habilitation thesis to the university of breslau . with alexander von humboldt’s help dirichlet then moved to berlin in 1828, where he was appointed at the military college and would be able to teach at the university of berlin. soon after this he was appointed a professor at the university of berlin where he remained from 1828 to 1855. in 1829, during a trip, he met carl gustav jacob jacobi, at the time professor of mathematics at königsberg university. over the years they kept meeting and corresponding on research matters, in time becoming close friends. dirichlet was appointed to the berlin academy in 1831 and an improving salary from the university put him in a position to marry, and he married rebecca mendelssohn, one of the composer felix mendelssohn’s two sisters. in 1837 dirichlet proposed the modern concept of a function y = f (x) in which for every x, there is associated with it a unique y. this work was inspired by significant contributions he had made to the understanding on fourier series, particularly with respect to conditions of convergence. in mechanics he investigated the equilibrium of systems and potential theory, which led him to the dirichlet problem concerning harmonic functions with prescribed boundary values. dirichlet had a high teaching load at the university of berlin, being also required to teach in the military college and in 1853 he complained in a letter to his pupil leopold kronecker that he had thirteen lectures a week to give in addition to many other duties. it was therefore something of a relief when, on carl friedrich gauss’s death in 1855, he was offered his chair at göttingen. ernst eduard kummer was called to assume his position as a professor of mathematics in berlin. the quieter life in göttingen seemed to suit dirichlet. he had more time for research and some outstanding research students. however, sadly he was not to enjoy the new life for long. dirichlet died on 5 may 1859, in göttingen. at yovisto, you can learn more about number theoryin a lecture on gauss’ law.\\n',\n",
       " 'fritz zwicky and the dark matter.  fritz zwicky (1898 – 1974)on february 14, 1898, swiss astronomer fritz zwicky was born. he is best known for his proposal of he existence of dark matter and counts as one of the most important astronomers of the 20th century. fritz zwicky attended a grammar school in zurich, switzerland and enrolled at the eth zurich in order to study physics and mathematics afterwards. zwicky became a research assistant around 1922 and worked at the california institute of technology in pasadena starting from 1925. he received a scholarship by the rockefeller foundation. in california, he worked as a theoretical physicist and later astrophysicist at the observatories of mt.wilson and palomar.  he gained attention around 1933 when he coined the term ‘supernova‘ and theorized that they were most likely the transition of normal stars into neutron stars. in order to prove his hypthesis, fritz zwicky began hunting for supernovae. by the later 1930s, he is believed to have discovered more than a dozen of them. in his whole life, it is assumed that zwicky discovered more than 120 supernovae. during world war ii, fritz zwicky began to get active in pasadena in rocket engineering. also, he was known to establish a program for academic libraries that suffered from the war. in the later 1940s, zwicky became the scientific director of the company aerojet and worked on the improvement of engines, which resulted in several patents.  fritz zwicky is by many remembered as the father of dark matter  even though this has been a topic of discussion. zwicky first recognized that in rich clusters of galaxies, a large portion of the matter is not visible. in 1933, he published a scientific work, estimating that “the total mass of the coma cluster of galaxies from the motions of the galaxies within that cluster. using the virial theorem he came to the conclusion that the galaxies were on average moving too fast for the coma cluster to be held together only by the mass of the visible matter”: “in order to receive an average doppler effect of 1000 km/s or more, which is what we have observed, the average density in the coma system would have to be at least 400 times greater than that of visible matter. if this can be shown to be the case, then it would have the surprising result that dark matter is present in the universe in far greater density than visible matter.” it has been argued that fritz zwicky’s analysis was deduced from limited statistics, but still, his estimation results were considered reasonable. the same calculation done today shows a smaller factor than the one zwicky proposed back in the 1930s, based on greater values for the mass of luminous material. however, it is still clear that the great majority of matter appears to be dark.  during his lifetime, fritz zwicky was known to be a great speaker and was invited for talks numerous times. he also published a trmendous amount of scientific works. more than 500 publications were made by zwicky including his ‘morphological astronomy’ from 1957 and he was honored for his contributions to astronomy around the globe. in 1972, fritz zwicky received the gold medal by the royal astronomical society in london. at yovisto you may learn more about ‘the fifth element: astronomical evidence for black holes, dark matter, and dark energy‘ in a lecture by professor scott tremaine.\\n',\n",
       " 'henry steinway and the grand pianos.  heinrich engelhard steinweg (1797-1871). on february 15, 1797, german born american inventor and entrepreneur henry engelhard steinway was born. he invented the overstrung iron frame grand piano (1859) and is founder of the piano company steinway & sons. steinway was born heinrich engelhard steinweg in wolfshagen im harz, duchy of brunswick in the holy roman empire of the german nation (modern germany). his childhood was marked by many tragedies and twists of fate. he attended the common schools of his home town. several brothers were killed during the napoleonic war and steinway lost his father and remaining brother at age 15. as an orphan he was now thrown upon his own resources. in 1814 he joined the schwarze schar, the volunteer corps of frederick william, duke of brunswick wolfenbüttel in the war against napoleon’s occupation of parts of germany but remained in the garrison throughout the napoleonic war campaign of the hundred days in 1815. he left service on 23 june 1822 and began to work as a carpenter, and later he became an apprentice to an organ builder in the town of goslar. although he had no musical training, he displayed a talent in building musical instruments. the first instrument he built was a zither. he soon discovered his love for music and learned how to play the organ, and became a church organist. he started building instruments, though hidden in the kitchen of his house because of the strong rules of the guild. in braunschweig, he started by building guitars and zithers, and then graduated to pianos, of small proportions initially and gradually increasing in size. then, in 1835 he made the first square piano, which he presented to his bride juliane as a wedding gift. they later had seven children. in 1836 he built his first grand piano in his kitchen in the town of seesen. this piano was later named the “kitchen piano“. because of the unstable political climate following the revolutions of 1848 in the german states, steinweg decided to leave his hometown braunschweig to emigrate to new york city in 1850 with five of his sons. there, he anglicized his name to henry e. steinway upon advice from friends, who concluded that the german surname steinweg would be disadvantageous for doing business. steinway and his sons worked for other piano companies until they could establish their own production under the name of steinway & sons in 1853. the first factory was located at 81 walker street, in manhattan. a new factory was founded in 1859 at park avenue and 53rd street, the present site of the seagrams building, where it covered a whole block. all the children, with the exception of christian friedrich theodor, who had remained in germany, worked in the business. the overstrung scale in a square piano earned the steinway piano first prize at the new york industrial fair of 1855. according to franz liszt, anton rubinstein, and other high authorities, the steinways have done more to advance the durability, action, and tone quality of their instruments than any other makers of europe or america. important among steinway’s innovations were the overstrung scale, a design in which the bass strings cross over the higher ones, permitting longer bass strings and improved tone. moreover, steinway used an improved cast iron frame that bore the tension of the strings without twisting as wooden frames tend to do. the steinways’ further improvements in piano design included methods for improving the action, or key mechanism; redesigning the iron frame and case to allow increased string tension; and strengthening the soundboard. in 1866 steinway & sons opened the first steinway hall on 14th street in manhattan. with a main auditorium of 2000 seats, it became new york city’s artistic and cultural center, housing the new york philharmonic until carnegie hall opened in 1891. at yovisto, you can learn more about the history of the piano in the lecture of prof. craig wright from yale university. this lecture addresses the history of the modern piano and its music.\\n',\n",

       " 'frederick eugene ives and the halftone printing process.  frederic eugene ives (1856–1937)  .  on february 17, 1856, american photographer and inventor frederic eugene ives was born. he is probably best known for his invention of the halftone process, a method of reproducing photographs on a printing press. in 1881, he was the first to make a three colour print from halftone blocks. further inventions in photography and color printing yielded 70 patents. born near litchfield, connecticut, ives after receiving a public school education apprenticed as a young man at the litchfield enquirer newspaper, where he became interested in photography and soon after opened a photographic studio in ithaca, new york. already at age 18, ives became the head of the cornell university photographic laboratory in 1875. there, ives began to study and experiment in the field of photographic reproduction. newspapers and other print media at the time had not yet been able to harness the potential of photography. the reason for this was in the printing process itself. printing involved pressing an engraved plate coated with ink onto paper. the challenge now was to find a way to translate finely shaded pictures such as photographs onto plates. turning his attentions exclusively to photographic experimentation in 1878, ives studied the process of photoengraving, through which designs are projected onto plates treated with light sensitive substances, to create engravings. at cornell, he developed the swelled gelatin process, which refined the sensitivity of the photoengraving process using a gelatin based coating. however, the new process still could only reproduce black lines on white. to translate the gradations of shading in photographs, ives hit upon the idea of breaking down photographs into dots of various sizes to convey shades, or so called “halftones,” which gave the name to the process that should revolutionize printed illustrations. prior to such processes, images were printed in books and periodicals by means of hand engraved metal plates or wood blocks, or from drawings made on lithographic stones. half tone effects were obtained by engraving closely spaced parallel or hatched lines, by stippling, or by exploiting the granular texture inherent in the stone lithography process. ives was not the first to experiment with halftone processes in printing. but, his objective was more or less to automatically convert the intermediate tones of a photographic image into small lines or dots of stark black and white. as well, is process should perform better, or at least more efficiently, than was possible with existing processes. furthermore, it was his goal to create a printing block that could be combined with blocks of text in an ordinary printing press. the lines or dots, of varying widths or sizes respectively, had to be small enough to adequately blend together in the eye at a normal viewing distance, producing the illusion of various shades of gray, yet the printing plates had to be durable enough to last through a typical press run without excessive degradation. above all, the process had to be economical enough to make its widespread commercial use practical. ives patented his first “ives’ process” in 1881, which required the creation of a photographic relief image, made by a variety of the carbon process, from which a plaster cast was made. the highest areas on the surface of the plaster corresponded with the darkest areas of the original photograph. the cast was pressed into contact with an inked rubber grid consisting of an array of tiny pyramidal elements, which caused a regular array of ink dots to be deposited on the plaster, their sizes varying according to the heights of the surface. the dot pattern was then photographed onto a metal plate coated with photoresist, which was developed and chemically etched, a process known as photoengraving and already in use for making printing plates from line drawings, handwriting and other purely black and white subject matter. although complex, this process was simpler and more efficient than other processes, and put in commercial operation in 1884. a few years later, ives replaced this process with the much simpler one, where an ordinary photograph was rephotographed directly onto the sensitized metal plate. during the 1890s, this “ives process” largely replaced the use of hand engraved wood block and steel plate illustrations and remained the standard process for photographically illustrating books, magazines and newspapers during the next eight decades.   an ives kromogram issued in 1897   but, ives also was a pioneer in the field of color photography. he first demonstrated a system of natural color photography in 1885. his fully developed kromskop color photography system was commercially available already by late 1897. three separate black and white photographs of the subject were taken through carefully adjusted red, green and blue filters. then, transparent positives of the three images were viewed in ives’ kromskop with red, green and blue filters and transparent reflectors to visually combine them into one full color image. the quality of the color was highly praised but the system was not a commercial success. it was discontinued shortly after the 1907 introduction of the autochrome process, which was simple to use and required no special equipment. in 1903 ives patented the parallax stereogram, the first “no glasses” autostereoscopic 3-d display technology. the device was able to present the illusion of a three dimensional image. however, to achieve this effect, the image had to be viewed from a specific vantage point or the image’s 3-d qualities would be lost. ives received several medals and recognitions for his photographic inventions, which included the prestigious progress medal of london’s royal photographic society for his contributions to color photography. frederic ives died in philadelphia on may 27, 1937.   at yovisto you can learn more about the history of photography in the presentation of nancy crandall about the origins and beginnings

       " 'octave chanute – one of the fathers of aviation.  octave a. chanute (1832-1910).  .  on february 18, 1832, french born american railway engineer and aviation pioneer octave chanute was born. he provided many budding enthusiasts, including the wright brothers with help and advice, and helped to publicize their flying experiments. at his death he was hailed as the father of aviation and the heavier than air flying machine. immigrating to the united states with his father in 1838, chanute attended private schools in new york city. his first job was as a member of a surveying crew with the hudson river railroad. he then worked his way up through a series of increasingly responsible engineering positions on western railroads. in addition, he served as chief engineer on a variety of important projects, notably the construction of the first bridge across the missouri river. chanute was widely considered brilliant and innovative in the engineering profession. during his career he designed and constructed the united states‘\\u200b two biggest stock yards, chicago stock yards (1865) and kansas city stockyards (1871). he designed and built the hannibal bridge which was the first bridge to cross the missouri river in kansas city, missouri, in 1869 and established kansas city as the dominant city in the region. he designed many other bridges during his railroad career. chanute also established a procedure for pressure treating wooden railroad ties with an antiseptic that increased the wood’s lifespan in the tracks. in 1883, chanute retired from the erie railway to become an independent engineering consultant. already in 1875, he had visited europe and learned of the extensive efforts being made there, particularly by  wenham in england, to develop mechanical flight. not until he retired from his engineering business in 1889 did chanute have opportunity for personal study and experiment in aeronautics. with the same analytical persistence that had made him a successful engineer he undertook to learn what had gone before. chanute collected all available data from flight experimenters around the world and combined it with the knowledge gathered as a civil engineer in the past. he published his findings in the influential book progress in flying machines in 1894. this was the most systematic global survey of fixed wing heavier than air aviation research published up to that time.   a twelve winged glider of chanute’s design, prepared for launch from the dunes of miller beach in 1896.   chanute was too old to fly himself, so he partnered with younger experimenters, including augustus m. herring and william avery. in 1896 chanute, herring, and avery tested a design based on the work of german aviation pioneer otto lilienthal, as well as hang gliders of their own design in the dunes along the shore of lake michigan near the town of miller beach, indiana, just east of what became the city of gary. chanute also sponsored the work of others, including the albatross by bustov and a paper tube glider that was ruined by a rainstorm before it could be tested. these experiments convinced chanute that the best way to achieve extra lift without a prohibitive increase in weight was to stack several wings one above the other, an idea proposed by the british engineer francis wenham in 1866 and realized in flight by otto lilienthal in the 1890s. chanute introduced the “strut wire” braced wing structure that would be used in powered biplanes of the future, not seriously challenged until the pioneering efforts of hugo junkers to develop all metal cantilever airframe technology without external bracing from 1915 onwards. the wright brothers based their glider designs on the chanute “double decker,” as they called it. a new design of a biplane glider was developed and flown in 1897. chanute corresponded with many aviation pioneers, including otto lilienthal, gabriel voisin, louis blériot, and alberto santos dumont. chanute freely shared his knowledge about aviation with anyone who was interested and expected others to do the same, although he did encourage colleagues to patent their inventions. his open approach led to friction with the wright brothers, with whom he had exchanged more than 100 letters between 1900 and 1910. nevertheess, chanute helped to publicize the wright brothers’\\u200b work, and provided consistent encouragement. he also witnessed many of the early wright flights, including the 1902 glider and 1904 and 1905 powered flyer. chanute died on november 23, 1910, in chicago, illinois.   at yovisto you can learn more about the future of aviation and space flight in the presentation from marc millis on ‘space flight predictions: after ai & transhumanism‘\\n',\n",
       " 'robert e. peary’s arctic expedition.  robert edwin peary (1856-1920). on february 20, 1920, american polar explorer robert edwin peary passed away. peary made the first successful expedition to the north pole arriving 6 apr 1909 with his assistant matthew henson and four inuit eskimo companions. peary’s claim was widely credited for most of the 20th century, rather than the competing claim by frederick cook, who said he got there a year earlier. both claims were widely debated in newspapers until 1913. robert edwin peary was born in cresson, pennsylvania on may 6, 1856, to charles n. and mary p. peary. peary attended bowdoin college, north of portland, maine, where his mother has moved after the death of peary’s father in 1859. peary graduated in 1877 with a civil engineering degree and then worked as a draftsman making technical drawings in washington, dc, at the us coast and geodetic survey office. he joined the united states navy in 1881 as a civil engineer with the relative rank of lieutenant. three years later, he began his career in exploration as chief assistant on a surveying expedition to nicaragua. although he was initially assigned to duty in the tropics, he resolved to become the first man to reach the north pole.   in april 1886 he wrote a paper for the national academy of sciences proposing two methods for crossing greenland’s ice cap. between 1886 and 1897, robert peary led five expeditions to greenland and arctic canada. in his 1891 expedition, peary returned to greenland with seven companions, including frederick a. cook, who in 1909 would claim to have reached the north pole before peary. on this expedition peary sledged 2100km to northeastern greenland, discovered independence fjord, and found evidence of greenland’s being an island. he also studied the “arctic highlanders,” an isolated eskimo tribe who helped him greatly on later expeditions. peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on january 5, 1901, and to commander on april 6, 1902. between 1898 and 1902 peary explore routes to the pole from etah, in inglefield land, northwestern greenland, and from fort conger, ellesmere island, in the canadian northwest territories. he departed new york harbor for the arctic in july 1898. by august, his ship was icebound after crossing smith sound, nearly 1100km from the pole. while establishing and supplying a base on the edge of the polar sea, peary had both feet badly frozen and suffered the amputation of eight toes. he stayed in the arctic until the fall of 1902 carrying out an extensive exploration of the region and in the spring of 1902 made the nearest approach yet to the pole in the american arctic, 84°17′ north. in september 1903, supported by president theodore roosevelt, peary was given three years leave to pursue another attempt on the pole. a problem in the previous attempt was the lack of a ship capable of forcing a passage through the ice to a high enough latitude for a cross polar dash. peary’s arctic club raised $100000 for the expedition and built such a ship, the roosevelt. this time the explorers would use eskimo methods and clothing, and travel in individual dog sledges. in july 1905 the roosevelt sailed north from new york and reached the north coast of grant land by september. peary struck out for the pole from cape hecla in march 1906. however, after two weeks of travel across broken ice fields, and open leads, the conditions of his dogs and his declining food supply forced him and his associates to turn back. nevertheless, he reached latitude 87° 6’ north, 280km from the pole and the farthest north anyone had ever reached.   admiral peary’s diary entry for arrival at the north pole   for his final expedition to reach the pole, peary and 23 men set off from new york city on july 6, 1908 aboard the roosevelt. they wintered near cape sheridan on ellesmere island, and from ellesmere departed for the pole on february 28 – march 1, 1909. the last support party was turned back from “bartlett camp” on april 1, 1909, in latitude no greater than 87°45′ north. on the final stage of the journey toward the north pole, peary continued with five assistants, none capable of making navigation observations. on april 6, 1909, he established “camp jesup” allegedly within 8 km of the pole. peary returned to civilization only to discover that his former colleague, cook, who had been a surgeon on the 1891–1892 peary expedition, was claiming to have reached the north pole independently in april 1908. cook’s claim, though subsequently discredited, marred peary’s enjoyment of his triumph. in 1911 peary retired from the navy with the rank of rear admiral. peary’s claim to have reached the north pole was almost universally accepted, but in the 1980s the examination of his 1908–09 expedition diary and other newly released documents cast doubt on whether he had actually reached the pole.   at yovisto, you can watch a movie by

       " 'john mercer and the cotton mercerisation.  john mercer (1791 – 1866).  on february 21, 1791, english dye and fabric chemist john mercer was born. he invented the mercerisation process for treating cotton which is still in use today and was a pioneer in colour photography. john mercer grew up in lancashire, england. he entered the textile industry as a bobbin winder when he was still a boy. the art of dyeing came to mercer’s interest approximately at the age of 16. he set up a dye laboratory at his home and experimented with mixing colors and soon began a partnership with an investor. they opened a small dyeing shop, which was considered quite successful.  after several years of experience as a simple weaver, mercer returned to the profession of a dyer and increased his enthusiasm in chemistry. mercer managed to produce a new orange dye, which was found good for calico printing. in the late 1810s, mercer was employed by the fort brothers, a textile printing company. mercer was employed as a color chemist and after making progress with further colors including indigo, yellow, and orange, the chemist was made the company’s partner in 1825.  despite the profitable partnership with the fort brothers, mercer had no more chance to develop new chemicals for textile processing in his laboratory. he dissolved the partnership in 1848 and devoted all of his time and resources to pursue his own research. it is believed that mercer had wondered about the effect upon cotton fabric of sodas, acids, and chlorides. he came to realize that the material became thicker and shorter when treated with these chemicals. these early experiments turned out to be mercer’s most important. the process made the cotton stronger and more easily dyed. john mercer called this process mercerization. it was patented in 1850. it became clear that mercerization could be easily applied to many other materials. to this day, mercerization is an important part of the cotton finishing process. john mercer was made a fellow of the royal society in 1850 and he was acknowledged the ‘father of textile chemistry’.  mercer was also interested in photography and especially photochemistry. he managed to develop processes for photographic printing on fabric .  at yovisto you may learn more about the industrial revolution in a lecture by john merriman at yale university.\\n',\n",
       " 'frank p. ramsey and the ramsey theory.  frank p. ramsey (1903-1930). on february 22, 1903, precocious british philosopher, mathematician and economist frank plumpton ramsey was born. although he died already at age 26, he had made significant contributions to logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of language and decision theory. he remains noted for his ramsey theory, a mathematical study of combinatorial objects in which a certain degree of order must occur as the scale of the object becomes large. frank p. ramsey was born as the eldest of four siblings in cambridge where his father arthur stanley ramsey, also a mathematician, was president of magdalene college. his brother michael ramsey later should become archbishop of canterbury. ramsey entered winchester college in 1915 and later returned to cambridge to study mathematics at trinity college. at trinity college, ramsey became a student to john maynard keynes. he became a senior scholar in 1921 and graduated as a wrangler in the mathematical tripos of 1923. then, ramsey went to vienna for a short while, returning to cambridge where he was elected a fellow of king’s college cambridge in 1924, which was rather unsusual, because in fact ramsey was only the second person ever to be elected to a fellowship at king’s college, not having previously studied at king’s. in 1926 he was appointed as a university lecturer in mathematics and he later became a director of studies in mathematics at king’s college. it was a short career, for sadly ramsey died at the beginning of 1930. suffering from chronic liver problems, ramsey developed jaundice after an abdominal operation and died on 19 january 1930 at guy’s hospital in london at the age of 26. however, in the short time during which he lectured at cambridge he had already established himself as an outstanding lecturer. he published his first major work the foundations of mathematics in 1925, in which he accepted the claim by russell and whitehead made in the principia mathematica that mathematics is a part of logic. already at the age of 19, ramsey was able to make the first draft of the translation of the german text of ludwig wittgenstein’s tractatus logico philosophicus, wittgenstein’s seminal work that aimed to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science. ramsey was very impressed by wittgenstein’s work and after graduating in 1923 he made a journey to austria to visit wittgenstein. for two weeks ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the tractatus. wittgenstein made some corrections to the english translation in ramsey’s copy and some annotations and changes to the german text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933. in his second paper on mathematics on a problem of formal logic, which was published in the proceedings of the london mathematical society in 1930, he examined methods for determining the consistency of a logical formula and included some theorems on combinatorics which have led to the study of a whole new area of mathematics called ramsey theory. the combinatorics was introduced by ramsey to solve a special case of the decision problem for the first order predicate calculus. ramsey theory studies the conditions under which order must appear. problems in ramsey theory typically ask a question of the form: “how many elements of some structure must there be to guarantee that a particular property will hold?” ramsey made a systematic attempt to base the mathematical theory of probability on the notion of partial belief. this work on probability, and also important work on economics, came about mainly because ramsey was a close friend of john meynard keynes. being a friend of keynes did not stop ramsey attacking keynes’ work, however, and in truth and probability (1926) he argues against keynes’ ideas of an a priori inductive logic. ramsey’s arguments convinced keynes who then abandoned his own ideas. in economics, ramsey wrote two papers a contribution to the theory of taxation and a mathematical theory of saving. these would lead to important new areas in the subject. in a mathematical theory of saving, published in the economic journal in late 1928, ramsey aimed to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest (save) rather than consume so as to maximize future utility, or in ramsey’s words “how much of its income should a nation save?” keynes described the article as “one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made. the ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for optimal accumulation theory although its importance was not recognized until many years after its first publication. at yovisto, you can learn more about the work of frank p. ramsey in the lecture “a dictator theorem of belief revision derived from arrow’s theorem” at lmu munich, where hannes leitgeb discusses the ramsey test for conditionals.\\n',\n",

       " 'nikolai lobachevsky – the copernicus of geometry.  nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky (1792-1856). on february 24, 1856, russian mathematician and geometer nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky passed away. he is known primarily for his work on hyperbolic geometry. lobachevsky’s main achievement is the development (independently from jános bolyai) of a non euclidean geometry, also referred to as lobachevskian geometry. nikolai lobachevsky was born as one of three children either in or near the city of nizhny novgorod in russia in 1792 to parents of polish origin. his father ivan maksimovich lobachevsky, a clerk in a land surveying office, died when he was seven, and his mother moved to kazan. financed by government scholarships, lobachevsky attended kazan gymnasium from 1802, graduating in 1807 and then received a scholarship to kazan university, which was founded just three years earlier in 1804. his original intention was to study medicine but he changed to study a broad scientific course involving mathematics and physics. at kazan university, lobachevsky was influenced by professor johann christian martin bartels, a former school teacher and friend of german mathematician carl friedrich gauss. bartels was noted for his encyclopedic knowledge of mathematics and soon interested lobachevsky in mathematics. lobachevsky received a master’s degree in physics and mathematics in 1811. in 1814, he became a lecturer at kazan university, in 1816 he was promoted to associate professor, and in 1822, at the age of 30, he became a full professor, teaching mathematics, physics, and astronomy, the same year in which he began an administrative career as a member of the committee formed to supervise the construction of new university buildings. he served in many administrative positions and became the rector of kazan university in 1827, where he stayed until 1846, when he was dismissed due to his deteriorating health. the university of kazan flourished while lobachevsky was rector, and this was largely due to his influence. by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. nevertheless, lobachevsky continued his mathematical activity until he died in poverty in 1856. “there is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.” (nokolay ivanovitch lobachevsky, quoted in george edward martin, the foundations of geometry and the non euclidean plane, springer (1998 ), p. 225) lobachevsky’s main achievement is the development (independently from jános bolyai) of a non euclidean geometry. since euclid’s axiomatic formulation of geometry mathematicians had been trying to prove his fifth postulate as a theorem deduced from the other four axioms. the fifth postulate states that given a line and a point not on the line, a unique line can be drawn through the point parallel to the given line. lobachevsky did not try to prove this postulate as a theorem. instead he studied geometry in which the fifth postulate does not necessarily hold. lobachevsky categorized euclidean as a special case of this more general geometry. this idea was first reported in 1826 to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and the first publication of this research appeared in 1829–1830 only in a small kazan periodical as a concise outline of the foundations of geometry, which was rejected when it was submitted to the st. petersburg academy of sciences for publication. lobachevsky based his geometry on the following assumption: in the plane formed by a line and a point not on the line it is possible to draw infinitely many lines through the point that are parallel to the original line. it was later proved that his geometry was self consistent and, as a result, that the parallel postulate is independent of euclid’s other axioms—hence, not derivable as a theorem from them. in the poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane, lines are represented by circular arcs orthogonal to the boundary of the closure of the disc. the thin black lines meet at a common point and do not intersect the thick blue line, illustrating that in the hyperbolic plane there are infinitely many lines parallel to a given line passing through the same point. (wikipedia) lobachevsky called his work “imaginary geometry,” but as a sympathizer with the empirical spirit of francis bacon, he attempted to determine the “true” geometry of space by analyzing astronomical data obtained in the measurement of the parallax of stars. a physical interpretation of lobachevsky’s geometry on a surface of negative curvature was discovered by the italian mathematician eugenio beltrami in 1868. in 1842 lobachevsky’s work was noticed and highly praised by gauss, at whose instigation lobachevsky was elected that year as a corresponding member of the royal society of göttingen. in addition to his geometry, lobachevsky obtained interesting results in algebra and analysis, such as the lobachevsky criterion for convergence of an infinite series (1834–36). his research interests also included the theory of probability, integral calculus, mechanics, astronomy, and meteorology. the real significance of lobachevsky’s new geometry was not fully understood and appreciated until the work of bernhard riemann on the foundations of geometry (1868) and the proof of the consistency of non euclidean geometry by felix klein in 1871. at yovisto, you can learn more about non euclidian geometry in the history of mathematics lecture of professor n. j. wildberger “mathhist12 – non euclidian geometry“.\\n',\n",
       " 'camille flammarion and his balancing act between popular science and science fiction.  nicolas camille flammarion (1842-1925). on february 26, 1848, french astronomer and author nicolas camille flammarion was born. he maintained a private observatory, where he studied double and multiple stars, the moon and mars. he is best known as a prolific author of more than fifty titles, including popular science works about astronomy, several notable early science fiction novels, and works on psychical research and related topics. camille flammarion was born in montigny le roi, haute marne, france, of humble parents. he was a precocious boy mastering to read and to write already at the age of four. at the age ten, flammarion was placed in a seminary, and continued his education under the care of the jesuits. at the age 15, he was apprenticed to an engraver, and worked in his shop for some months. whilst thus engaged, however, he managed to continue his studies, mastered english and the classics, and was able earn the degree of bachelor, as well as his matriculation to the polytechnic school, and at the age of sixteen to enter the paris observatory as pupil astronomer. as a young man, flammarion was exposed to two significant social movements in the western world: the thoughts and ideas of charles darwin and jean baptiste lamarck, and the rising popularity of spiritism with spiritualist churches and organizations appearing all over europe. he was influenced by jean reynaud and his terre at ciel (1854), which described a religious system based on the transmigration of souls believed to be reconcilable with both christianity and pluralism. he was convinced that souls after the physical death pass from planet to planet, progressively improving at each new incarnation. according to  flammarion at that time was already the author of a work entitled the cosmogony of the universe greatly admired by famous astronomer urbain le verrier, to whose influence he principally owed his admission to the observatory. there, flammarion was attached to the bureau des calculs, and had the good fortune to be able to make certain observations of comets which have been described as the most interesting that have been made during this century. at the same time he found time to write his next work, the plurality of inhabited worlds. (1862). in real and imaginary worlds (1864) and lumen (1887), he described a range of exotic species, including sentient plants which combine the processes of digestion and respiration. this belief in extraterrestrial life, flammarion combined with a religious conviction derived from the writings of jean reynaud and their emphasis upon the transmigration of souls. influenced by his fellow frenchman allan kardec, flammarion became interested in psychical studies, which also influenced some of his science fiction writings, where he would write about his beliefs in a cosmic version of metempsychosis. among other things, flammarion believed that all planets went through more or less the same stages of development, but at different rates depending on their sizes. flammarion approached spiritism, psychical research and reincarnation from the viewpoint of the scientific method. he had studied mediumship and wrote “it is infinitely to be regretted that we cannot trust the loyalty of mediums. they almost always cheat“. however, flammarion a believer in psychic phenomena attended séances and produced in his book alleged levitation photographs, which were considered only little convincing. his book the unknown (1900) received a negative review due to a lack of critical judgment in the estimation of evidence. after two years investigation into automatic writing flammarion wrote that the subconscious mind is the explanation and there is no evidence for the spirit hypothesis. flammarion believed in the survival of the soul after death but wrote that mediumship had not been scientifically proven. he also believed that telepathy could explain some paranormal phenomena. the fusion of science, science fiction and the spiritual influenced other readers as well. with great commercial success he blended scientific speculation with science fiction to propagate modern myths such as the notion that “superior” extraterrestrial species reside on numerous planets, and that the human soul evolves through cosmic reincarnation. authors such as edgar rice burroughs, olaf stapledon are referring to him and arthur conan doyle’s the poison belt (1913) has a lot in common with flammarion’s worries that the tail of halley’s comet would be poisonous for earth life. in the 1920s flammarion, a member of the theosophical society, changed some of his beliefs on apparitions and hauntings but still claimed there was no evidence for the spirit hypothesis of mediumship in spiritism. in his 1924 book haunted houses he came to the conclusion that in some rare cases hauntings are caused by departed souls whilst others are caused by the “remote action of the psychic force of a living person. famous engraving in camille flammarion’s 1888 book l’atmosphère: météorologie populaire ok, usually we are dealing with ‘serious’ scientists. why do we mention camille flammarion, who besides being an author of popular books believed some esoteric parapsychological phenomena? well, because of the so called flammarion engraving, which is also the title picture of this article. the flammarion engraving is a wood engraving by an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in camille flammarion’s 1888 book l’atmosphère: météorologie populaire the engraving has often, but erroneously, been referred to as a woodcut. it has been used to represent a supposedly medieval cosmology, including a flat earth bounded by a solid and opaque sky, or firmament, and also as a metaphorical illustration of either the scientific or the mystical quests for knowledge. in 1957, astronomer ernst zinner claimed that the image dated to the german renaissance, but he was unable to find any version published earlier than 1906. further investigation, however, revealed that the work was a composite of images characteristic of different historical periods, and that it had been made with a burin, a tool used for wood engraving only since the late 18th century. nevertheless, i like the picture of the man looking beyond his earthly horizon and use this also as an illustration in my lectures. at yovisto, you may enjoy a short video lecture by carl sagan, a more or less contemporary but definitely more scientific version of camille flammarion, explaining the 4th dimension.\\n',\n",

(1968) this is not one of our usual daily history in science posts. today, we want to pay tribute to an actor who played an extraordinary character that has become an icon: leonard nimoy and his alter ego spock, the scientific officer aboard the starship uss enterprise. i was shocked yesterday evening by the news of leonard nimoy’s passing. as spock, he was one of my childhood’s heroes. and not only one of them, spock was the hero and role model, one of the main reasons why i have become a scientist. probably this also holds for many others of my generation who later should become a scientist. when i grew up, one of the very first moments i remember having seen on tv was one of the apollo moon missions. i was so sure that one day i should become an astronaut, although i only knew that astronauts are doing cool things in fancy suits somewhere in space and other planets. but, i don’t remember having seen anything personal of these astronauts. it was simply because they were riding in space ships doing incredible cool things. but then one day, i saw star trek, the original series, on tv. suddenly, the astronauts have become “real life” persons. and wow, they were involved in some cool space adventures, too. i immediately became addicted to technology, fancying about the possibilities of space travel, warp drive, and teleportation. the main character of the tv series was captain james t. kirk, a classical heroic figure that is said to be heavily influenced by  forester’s horatio hornblower, but always with a twinkle in the eye. nobody else but william shatner was able to bring him to live and we all love him for that. but for a boy like me, of course the scientific officer spock,the laconic and imperturbable extra terrestrial from planet vulcan, living on perfect logic unable to express emotions, was the much more ‘fascinating’ character. (almost) nobody was able to raise any visible emotions or anger in him. well, besides raising one of his eyebrows maybe. while captain kirk usually solved conflicts with his bare fists, spock didn’t need to. he had his reasoning based on pure logic. thus, spock also became the centre of star trek’s optimistic vision of humanity’s future. solving conflicts peacefully by the application of logic. that was also one of the goals that famous mathematician and philosopher gottfried wilhelm leibniz (futilely in his times) aimed to achieve by applying his logical calculus to language. today, understanding (natural) language as well as the content of images, audio files, and videos by application of machine learning, statistics, linguistics, and logics, has become one of my main research fields as a computer scientist. and as you might guess, there is still a long way to go… what later became much more interesting for me about spock was the constant struggle with his both legacies, human and vulcan. he was “struggling to maintain a vulcan attitude, a vulcan philosophical posture and a vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion.” thank you, leonard nimoy for sharing with us this optimistic and inspiring character! you taught us to ‘live long and prosper.’ read more: http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/leonard nimoy star treks spock dead at 83-20150227#ixzz3t3ynn3zj follow us: @rollingstone on twitter | rollingstone on facebook references:  dillard, j. m.

       " 'jeremias richter and the law of definite proportions.  jeremias benjamin richter (1762-1807).  .  on march 10, 1762, german chemist jeremias benjamin richter was born. he discovered the law of definite proportions and is best known for introducing the term stoichiometry, i.e. the calculation of relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions. jeremias benjamin richter was born at hirschberg in silesia, today’s jelenia góra in western poland. he graduated from the hirschberg gymnasium, and in 1778 joined the engineering corps of the prussian army. richter devoted his spare time to studying chemistry and, after seven years, left the army to enter the university of königsberg, where he studied mathematics and philosophy and probably attended immanuel kant’s lectures. he was awarded the doctorate in 1789 with the dissertation de usu matheseos in chemia, in which he set out the determinations of the specific gravities of a number of substances, both compounds and solutions, and attempted to determine the weight of phlogiston. richter went to gross ober tschirnau, near glogau, in lower silesia, where he established a laboratory and supported himself by chemical research and making aerometers. in 1795 he became secretary and assayer to the oberbergamt at breslau (now wrocław), and in 1798 he became “second areanist,” or chemist, at the royal porcelain works at berlin. richter was a corresponding member of the gross britaunnische societät of göttingen and of the munich and st. petersburg academies. he never held an academic position, never married, and died of tuberculosis at the age of forty five. as a chemist, richter is responsible for some of the earliest determinations of the quantities by weight in which acids saturate bases and bases acids, and of arriving at the conception that those amounts of different bases which can saturate the same quantity of a particular acid are equivalent to each other. driven by his achieved results, richter was led to conclude that chemistry is a branch of applied mathematics. actually, he wrote in the preface to the the principles of stoichiometry, or the art of measuring chemical elements (vols. 1–3, 1792–94): “all sciences concerned with magnitudes belong to mathematics. the reason that so little progress is made in this branch is that chemists only rarely occupy themselves with mathematics and mathematicians feel no call to make conquests for the art of measurement in the field of chemistry.“ thus he was able to trace a law according to which the quantities of different bases required to saturate a given acid formed an arithmetical progression, and the quantities of acids saturating a given base a geometric progression. in 1792, richter proposed the law of definite proportions, which gave evidence for the existence of atoms. richter found that the ratio by weight of the compounds consumed in a chemical reaction was always the same. it took 615 parts by weight of magnesia (mgo), for example, to neutralize 1000 parts by weight of sulfuric acid. from his data, ernst gottfried fischer calculated in 1802 the first table of chemical equivalents, taking sulphuric acid as the standard with the figure 1000. richter defines his new science of stoichiometry, as “the science of measuring the quantitative proportions or mass ratios in which chemical elements strand one to another.” the law of definite proportions and constant composition do not prove that atoms exist, but they are difficult to explain without assuming that chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine in constant proportions. unfortunately richter’s writing style has been described as obscure and clumsy. despite his imaginative theorizing and skillful laboratory work, his chemical achievements passed almost unnoticed among his contemporaries until 1802, when it was summarized in ernst gottfried fischer’s tables. richter’s results had virtually no influence on the development of chemistry until after the acceptance of dalton’s atomic theory.   at yovisto, you may be interested in a short documentary on one of the founders of modern chemistry:  jöns jacob berzelius.\\n',\n",

       " 'george gamow and his fundamental views on the foundations of science.  bragg laboratory staff in 1931with george gamow at the rightmost.  on march 4, 1904, theoretical physicist and cosmologist george gamow was born. he was an early advocate and developer of george lemaître’s big bang theory. besides his contributions to physics, in his middle and late career, gamow focused more on teaching, and became well known as an author of popular books on science, which are still in print more than 50 years after their publication. gamow was born in odessa, russian empire (now in ukraine). his father was a high school teacher of russian language and literature and his mother taught geography and history at a school for girls. gamow was educated at the novorossiya university in odessa and at the university of leningrad, where he studied under alexander friedmann. he aspired to do his doctoral thesis under friedmann, but due to friedmann’s early death in 1925 had to change his advisors. at the university, gamow made friends with three fellow students of theoretical physics, lev landau, dmitri ivanenko, and matvey bronshtein, who formed a group known as the three musketeers. they met to discuss and analyze the ground breaking papers on quantum mechanics. on graduation, gamow worked on quantum theory in göttingen, where his research into the atomic nucleus provided the basis for his doctorate. from 1928 to 1931, he worked at the theoretical physics institute of the university of copenhagen with a break to work with ernest rutherford at the cavendish laboratory, cambridge. he continued to study the atomic nucleus, but also worked on stellar physics with robert atkinson and fritz houtermans. by 1928, gamow had solved the theory of the alpha decay of a nucleus via tunnelling, with mathematical help from nikolai kochin. in 1931 gamow was elected a corresponding member of the academy of sciences of the ussr already at age 28. gamow worked in the physical department of the radium institute (leningrad), where under the guidance and direct participation of igor kurchatov, lev mysovskii and george gamow, europe’s first cyclotron was designed in 1932. upon approval by the institute the cyclotron was not completed until 1937. gamow and his wife tried to leave the soviet union, with or without official permission. niels bohr and other friends invited gamow to visit during this period, but gamow could not get permission to leave. in 1933 gamow was suddenly granted permission to attend the 7th solvay conference on physics, in brussels. gamow was accompanied by his wife and arranged to extend their stay, with the help of marie curie and other physicists. over the next year, gamow obtained temporary work at the curie institute, university of london, and university of michigan. in 1934, gamow and his wife moved to the united states, where he became a professor at george washington university (gwu) and recruited physicist edward teller from london to join him. in 1936, gamow and teller published what became known as the “gamow–teller selection rule” for beta decay. by the late 1930s, gamow’s interests had turned towards astrophysics and cosmology. during world war ii, gamow did not work directly on the manhattan project producing the atomic bomb, in spite of his knowledge of radioactivity and nuclear fusion. he continued to teach physics at gwu, and consulted for the us navy. gamow further used his knowledge of nuclear reactions to interpret stellar evolution, collaborating with teller on a theory of the internal structures of red giant stars (1942). from his work on stellar evolution, gamow postulated that the sun’s energy results from thermonuclear processes. in 1945, he co authored a paper supporting work by german theoretical physicist carl friedrich von weizsäcker on planetary formation in the early solar system. gamow and teller were both proponents of the expanding universe theory that had been advanced by alexander friedmann, edwin hubble, and georges lemaître. gamow, however, modified the theory, and together with ralph alpher and hans bethe published this theory in a paper called the origin of chemical elements (1948). this paper, attempting to explain the distribution of chemical elements throughout the universe, posits a primeval thermonuclear explosion, the big bang that began the universe. according to the theory, after the big bang, atomic nuclei were built up by the successive capture of neutrons by the initially formed pairs and triplets. furthermore, they were postulating that before the big bang there existed a primordial state of matter, (ylem) consisting of neutrons and their decay products, protons and electrons, mixed together in a sea of high energy radiation—the basic ingredients necessary for the formation of deuterons and heavier, and heavier nuclei as the universe subsequently expanded. george gamow: one, two, three, …infinity (first published 1947) in 1954 gamow’s scientific interests grew to encompass biochemistry. shortly after j. d. watson and francis crick discovered the double helical structure of dna, gamow recognized that the information contained in the four different kinds of nucleotides (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine) constituting the dna chains could be translated into the sequence of twenty amino acids which form protein molecules by counting all possible triplets one can form from four different quantities. gamow’s contribution to solving the problem of genetic coding gave rise to important models of biological degeneracy. in 1956, gamow moved to the university of colorado boulder, where he remained for the rest of his career. gamow continued his teaching at the university of colorado boulder, and focused increasingly on writing textbooks and books on science for the general public. his popular writings were designed to introduce to the nonspecialist such difficult subjects as relativity and cosmology. his first such work, mr. tompkins in wonderland (1936), gave rise to the multivolume mr. tompkins series (1939–67). among his other writings are one, two, three . . . infinity (1947), the creation of the universe (1952), a planet called earth (1963), and a star called the sun (1964). on august 19, 1968, gamow died at age 64 in boulder, colorado. at yovisto, you can learn more about george

       " 'frederick reines and the neutrino.  frederick reines.  on march 16, 1918, american physicist and nobel laureate frederick reines was born. he is best known for his co detection of the neutrino with clyde cowan in the neutrino experiment. the neutrino is a subatomic particle, a tiny lepton with little or no mass and a neutral charge which had been postulated by wolfgang pauli in the early 1930s but had previously remained undiscovered. reines shared the nobel prize with physicist martin lewis perl, who discovered the tau lepton. frederick reines was born in paterson, new jersey in 1918 and he once described the day he became fascinated by science: “the first stirrings of interest in science that i remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, i noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. that began for me a fascination with light.”  his early education was mostly shaped by his older siblings, who became doctors of medicine and lawyers. also, reines’ scientific career was shaped by his membership in the boy scouts where he began to build crystal radios. in high school, reines was encouraged by a science teacher to use the school’s lab and in his year book he noted as his principal ambition “to be a physicist extraordinaire.” even though initially intending to enroll at mit, reines decided to go with the stevens institute of technology  to study engineering. reines received his master of science in mathematical physics in 1941 and continued his career at new york university, where he worked in experimental experimental cosmic ray physics under the direction of  korff, and wrote a theoretical ph.d thesis on “the liquid drop model for nuclear fission”. he was recruited by as a staff member under richard feynman in the theoretical division at the los alamos scientific laboratory, to work on the manhattan project. he directed his efforts to the basic understanding of the effects of nuclear blasts and coauthored a study of the air blast wave with john von neumann. in 1951, during a sabbatical in residence from his duties at los alamos, frederick reines decided to attempt the ovservation of the neutrino. he formed a colllaboration with clyde cowan and decided that the reactor at hanford, washington would suit best as source of neutrinos. in 1953, john wheeler contacted them about the new savannah river reactor facility being built in south carolina. the men transferred their operations there and observed the electron antineutrino in 1956. reines started the first series of experiments at the savannah river site to study the properties of the neutrino after cowan left los alamos. the neutrino was first postulated by wolfgang pauli in 1930 to explain how beta decay could possibly conserve energy, momentum, and angular momentum. he hypothesized that an undetected particle that he called a “neutron” and he considered that the new particle was emitted from the nucleus together with the electron or beta particle in the process of beta decay. two years later, james chadwick discovered a much more massive nuclear particle and also named it a neutron. enrico fermi, who developed the theory of beta decay, then coined the term neutrino to resolve the confusion. fermi published a paper in 1934, unifying pauli’s neutrino with paul dirac’s positron and werner heisenberg’s neutron – proton model and gave a solid theoretical basis for future experimental work. but when the journal nature rejected his paper, it was published to an italian journal and the general lack of interest in his theory back then probably caused fermi to switch to experimental physics. in 1942, wang ganchang first proposed the use of beta capture to experimentally detect neutrinos. in the 20 july 1956 issue of science, clyde cowan, frederick reines, f. b. harrison, h. w. kruse, and a. d. mcguire published confirmation that they indeed had detected the neutrino, a result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 nobel prize. in this experiment, now known as the cowan – reines neutrino experiment, antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with protons to produce neutrons and positrons. when reines also left los alamos in 1959, he became professor and head of the department of physics of the case institute of technology in cleveland, ohio. there his group worked in reactor neutrino physics, double beta decay, electron lifetime studies, searched for nucleon decay, and performed an experiment in a gold mine in south africa that made the first observation of the neutrinos produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. reines took his research group to the new university of california, irvine campus in 1966, where he became the dean of the school of physical sciences. reines later was appointed distinguished professor of physics at uci in 1987 and became professor emeritus in 1988. the “neutrino group” at irvine has been actively involved in a wide range of neutrino and elementary particle physics experiments, including its role in the irvine michigan brookhaven proton decay experiment. this group has continued the program of reactor neutrino experiments, has been the first to observe double beta decay in the laboratory, and was awarded the 1989 bruno rossi prize in high energy astrophysics by the american astronomical society for its joint observation of neutrinos from supernova 1987a. the detection of the supernova neutrinos was a particularly gratifying outcome of the imb experiment. at yovisto you may learn more about understanding neutrinos using deep dark science in a lecture by arthur b. mcdonald.\\n',\n",

georg philipp friedrich freiherr von hardenberg, better known under his pen name novalis passed away. in spite of his early death at age 28, novalis left behind a complex philosophical legacy that encompasses discussions of subjectivity and self consciousness, issues in epistemology, moral theory, political philosophy, problems of interpretation, philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, the proto existentialist experience of the finality of human life, as well as a significant contribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art. georg philipp friedrich von hardenberg was born in 1772 at oberwiederstedt manor, now part of arnstein, saxony anhalt, in the harz mountains, as second of eleven children to his strictly pietistic father heinrich ulrich erasmus freiherr von hardenberg, descended from ancient, low german nobility. he spent his childhood on the family estate and used it as the starting point for his travels into the harz mountains. first taught by private tutors, he attended the lutheran grammar school in eisleben. from the age of twelve, he moved to the home of his uncle, gottlob friedrich wilhelm von hardenberg, who is said to have taken an interest in french enlightenment philosophy. from 1790 to 1794, he studied law at jena, leipzig and wittenberg, where he passed his exams with distinction. in jena, he attended the lectures of friedrich schiller on history and later befriended schiller during his illness. during these years, he also met johann wolfgang goethe, johann gottfried herder as well as jean paul, and made close friends with ludwig tieck, the brothers friedrich and august wilhelm schlegel and friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling. von hardenberg passed his final exams in 1794 and moved on to work in the prussian civil service in tennstedt, where he also met the young sophie von kühn, with whom he got secretly engaged in 1795. two years later, sophie tragically died at the age of fifteen, an event that would move a whole generation of poets and artists in germany, including goethe. following in his father, von hardenberg commenced his studies of mining in freiberg, saxony, and eventually took up an administrative position at the salt mines in weißenfels, where he advanced to director of the salt mines. until 1796, von hardenberg concerned himself with the scientific teachings of johann gottlieb fichte, which greatly influenced his world view. he even extended fichte’s philosophic concepts by transforming fichte’s nicht ich (german “not i”) to a du (“you”), an equal subject to the ich (“i”). this was the starting point for von hardenberg’s liebesreligion (“religion of love”). von hardenberg’s first fragments were published in 1798 in the athenäum, a magazine edited by the brothers schlegel, who were also part of the early german romantic movement. his first publication was entitled blüthenstaub (pollen), a collection of 114 aesthetic philosophical fragments and reflections, and saw the first appearance of his pen name “novalis” – referring back to an old family name while, all the same, conveying the meaning of “the one who clears new ground”. still deeply affected by the death of his young fiancee sophie von kühn, novalis began his hymnen an die nacht (hymns to the night), which were published in 1800. in these six prose poems interspersed with verse he recounted his experience of sophie’s death. he celebrates night, or death, as an entry into a higher life in the presence of god and his conversion to a kind of christian mysticism in which he longed for his own death in order to be reunited with his beloved. novalis became engaged for the second time in december 1798 with julie von charpentier. unfortunately, he lived long enough to see the publication only of his works. his unfinished novels heinrich von ofterdingen and the novices at sais, his political speech christendom or europa, and numerous other notes and fragments were published posthumously by his friends ludwig tieck and friedrich schlegel. “..to philosophize is to throw off apathy, to become revived.” (novalis, studies in the history of the renaissance) on the december 6, 1800, the twenty eight year old novalis was appointed “supernumerar amtshauptmann” for the district of thuringia, a position comparable to that of a present day magistrate. but from august onward, he suffered from tuberculosis, and on march 25, 1801, he died in weißenfels. novalis’s last years were incredibly creative, filled with encyclopaedic studies, the draft of a philosophical system based on idealism, and poetic work. his mythical romance heinrich von ofterdingen, set in an idealized vision of the european middle ages, describes the mystical and romantic searchings of a young poet. the central image of his visions, a blue flower, became a widely recognized symbol of romantic longing among novalis’s fellow romantics.  the core of novalis’ literary works is the quest for the connection of science and poetry, and the result was supposed to be a “progressive universal poesy”. he was convinced that philosophy and the higher ranking poetry have to be continually related to each other. novalis’ poetry and writings were also an influence on hermann hesse. moreover, he also influenced indirectly c. s. lewis, the inklings, and the whole modern fantasy genre with his work. at yovisto you can learn more about a

       " 'aristarchus of samos and the heliocentric system.  aristarchus’s 3rd century bc calculations on the relative sizes of the sun, earth and moon   about 310 bc, ancient greek astronomer and mathematician aristarchus of samos was born. he presented the first known model that placed the sun at the center of the known universe with the earth revolving around it. as anaxagoras before him, he also suspected that the stars were just other bodies like the sun. his astronomical ideas were often rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of aristotle and ptolemy. apparently, aristarchus of samos was a student of, who was head of aristotle’s lyceum. it is not clear however, that aristarchus studied with strato in athens but rather that he studied with him in alexandria. aristarchus is mostly mentioned by vitruvius, who was famous as a roman architect and engineer, and the author of the important treatise ‘de architectura’. in this work vitruvius lists men who have been knowledgeable across all branches of science: men of this type are rare, men such as were, in past times, aristarchus of samos, philolaus and archytas of tarentum, apollonius of perga, eratosthenes of cyrene, archimedes and scopinas of syracuse, who left to posterity many mechanical and gnomonic appliances which they invented and explained on mathematical principles. vitruvius also explains that aristarchus invented a “sundial in the shape of a hemispherical bowl with a pointer to cast shadows placed in the middle of the bowl”. however, there are no clear evidences concerning the origin of aristarchus’s belief in a heliocentric system. the greeks had not accepted the hypothesis and therefore, it never gained enough popularity. apparently, historians only found out about aristarchus’s believes through archimedes. as archimedes reported aristarchus’ views, he also criticized them with “mathematically meaningless proportions”. during the 4th century bc, plato and aristotle defended the geocentric model but both philosophers did so using mostly mystical and mythical arguments. the stars and planets were carried around the earth on spheres, arranged in a concentric fashion. plato even described the “universe as the spindle of necessity, attended by the sirens and turned by the three fates”. plato explained that natural laws could not account for all the changes in the universe. plutarch also wrote about aristarchus, saying that he probably followed heraclides of pontus’  believes that the daily rotation of the fixed stars was a result of the rotation of the earth on its axis.  it is suggested that there is only one surviving work of aristarchus: “on the sizes and distances of the sun and moon”. however, the publication is not based on the sun centred theory. also, the work in which aristarchus probably described his theory on a heliocentric system is lost. “on the sizes and distances of the sun and moon” states that sun was about 20 times as distant from the earth as the moon, and 20 times the moon’s size. these estaimates were too small, which was probably the result of inaccurate instruments. it is believed that his work was published before aristarchus adapted the believe of a heliocentric system. [1,2,3] it is not clear if aristarchus sticked with his believe of the heliocentric system after most astronomers had rejected the theory. hipparchus of nicea was one of the most respected greek astronomers, who concluded that the geocentric model better explained the observations than did the model of aristarchus. it was found that the only way that aristarchus’ theory could stand mathematical analysis was by supposing an elliptical orbit of the earth, an assumption that was not accepted in the community. at yovisto you may learn more about ‘voyages to the outer solar system‘ in a lecture by ian morrison.\\n',\n",
       " 'hippolyte fizeau and the speed of light.  hippolyte fizeau (1819-1896). photo: charles reutlinger, académie des sciences, smithsonian institution libraries on september 23, 1819, french physicist armand hippolyte louis fizeau was born. he is well known for his calculation of the speed of light and his suggestion to use length of a light wave be used as a length standard. hippolyte fizeau was born in paris as the eldest son of béatrice and louis fizeau, who was professor of pathology at the paris medical school. he attended the prestigious collège stanislas in paris where he became a friend with one of his fellow students, léon foucault. in september 1839. famous louis daguerre put on a free course on his new photographic techniques in paris and the two friends fizeau and foucault attended. they watched daguerre expose a plate in a camera pointing out the window, then after talking about his process for about 30 minutes, he developed the plate using a variety of chemicals to reveal the picture. although fizeau and foucault were impressed they also realised the limitations of the process – it would be wonderful to be able to take portraits, they thought, but the subject could not be expected to remain motionless for 30 minutes. after the course ended they began to experiment to try to speed up the process.  fizeau entered the paris medical school in 1840, but he soon gave up on medicine because of severe migraines and spent some time travelling during which time he regained his health. his new focus of attention should be physics. he attended arago‘s lectures at the observatory, and enrolled in a course on optics at the collège de france. furthermore, he began to deeply study notebooks containing the lecture notes taken by his brother who attended courses at the école polytechnique. it was arago, who encouraged fizeau and foucault in 1845 and suggested that they might attempt to make photographs of an image of the sun produced by a telescope. thus, fizeau and foucault produced what is considered the first astronomical photography. it was in the field of optics that fizeau earned a lasting reputation. the original inspiration came from françois arago, who looked for a decisive test between the corpuscular and wave theories of light. if the wave theory was true, the velocity of light had to be greater in moving media, such as water flowing in a tube. the project implied the working out of a terrestrial method of measuring the speed of light, and arago suggested that this could be done by using a rotating mirror. in 1849, fizeau calculated a value for the speed of light more precise than the previous value determined by ole rømer in 1676. he used a beam of light reflected from a mirror eight kilometers away. the beam passed through the gaps between teeth of a rapidly rotating wheel. the speed of the wheel was increased until the returning light passed through the next gap and could be seen. fizeau calculated the speed of light to be 313300 kilometres per second, which was within about five percent of the correct value (299792.458 kilometers per second). fizeau published the first results obtained by his method for determining the speed of light in 1849. in 1851 he carried out a series of experiments in an attempt to detect the luminiferous ether—a hypothetical material that was thought to occupy all of space and to be necessary for carrying the vibrations of light waves. the experimental results failed to demonstrate the existence of the ether, but his work helped lead to the discarding of the ether theory in the early years of the 20th century. fizeau was elected a member of the academy of sciences in 1860, an a member of the bureau des longitudes in 1878. he received the decoration of the legion of honour in 1849 and became officer in 1875. in 1866 the royal society of london awarded him the rumford medal. at yovisto you can learn more about the physics behind the speed of light in the nasa documentary ‘einsteins cosmic speed limit‘.\\n',\n",

der untertan (the patrioteer, 1918); and der kopf (the chief, 1925) carries even further his indictment of the social types produced by the authoritarian state. heinrich mann was devastated in 1910 when his sister, clara mann, took her own life. two years later, mann married the actress maria kanová from prague. when his brother thomas mann, in gedanken im kriege (1915, thoughts in war), expressed support for the war, heinrich mann cut off all contact with him. it was in 1922, fostered by thomas mann’s wife katja, that the two brothers reconciled. after 1918 mann became a prominent spokesman for democracy. together with albert einstein and other celebrities, heinrich mann was a signatory to an open letter in the new york times condemning the murder of croatian scholar dr milan šufflay in 1931. in the same year, heinrich mann became the president of the poetry department of the prussian academy of the art, which was closed two years later on account of mann’s political activities, which included signing the appeal to the communist party of germany and the social democratic party of germany against the national socialists. mann became persona non grata in nazi germany and left even before the reichstag fire in 1933. he first went to france where he lived in paris and nice. during the german occupation he made his way through collaborationist vichy france to marseille where he succeeded to escape to spain and further to portugal and then to america. the nazis burnt heinrich mann’s books as “contrary to the german spirit” during the infamous book burning of may 10, 1933, which was instigated by propaganda minister joseph goebbels. during the 1930s and later in american exile, heinrich mann’s literary popularity went downhill. nevertheless, from 1935 to 1938 he wrote die jugend des königs henri quatre (young henry of navarre) and die vollendung des königs henri quatre (henri quatre: king of franc) as part of the exilliteratur. the two novels sketched the life and importance of henry iv of france and were acclaimed by his brother thomas mann. the plot, based on europe’s early modern history from a french perspective, anticipated the end of french–german enmity. in 1939, heinrich mann married his second wife nelly kröger, who suffered from mental illness and committed suicide in 1944 while the manns’ were living in california. during the emigration, became chairman of the preparatory commission of the german popular front and was named honorary president of the exiled social democratic party of germany. heinrich mann died in santa monica, california, lonely and without much money, just months before he was to move to east berlin to become president of the german academy of arts. at yovisto you can learn more about heinrich mann’s famous brother thomas mann in a seminar by the goethe institute boston on thomas mann and his stories.\\n',\n",
       " 'the visions of emanuel swedenborg.  emanuel swedenborg (1688-1772). on march 29, 1772, swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, and mystic emanuel swedenborg passed away. he is best known for his book on the afterlife, heaven and hell (1758). from swedenborg’s inventive and mechanical genius came his method of finding terrestrial longitude by the moon, new methods of constructing docks and even tentative suggestions for the submarine and the airplane. swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. in 1741, at age 53, he entered into a spiritual phase, in which for the remaining 28 years of his life, he wrote more or less theological works. emanuel swedenborg was born as emanuel swedberg was born on january 29, 1688, as third of nine children to his father jesper swedberg, who descended from a wealthy mining family, and sarah behm swedberg. jesper swedberg took interest in the beliefs of the dissenting lutheran pietist movement, which emphasized the virtues of communion with god rather than relying on sheer faith. while controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son emanuel’s spirituality. jesper swedberg would later become professor of theology at uppsala university and bishop of skara. from 1703 to 1709 swedenborg lived in the house of erik benzelius the younger, a prominent priest, theologian, librarian, and one of sweden’s important enlightenment figures. swedenborg completed his university courses at uppsala in 1709, where he studied mechanics, geography, astronomy, and mathematics. in 1710, he started his grand tour through the netherlands, france, and germany, before reaching london, where he would spend the next four years, studying physics, mechanics and philosophy and read and wrote poetry. in 1715 swedenborg returned to sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. a first step was his meeting with king charles xii of sweden in lund, in 1716. the swedish inventor christopher polhem, who became a close friend of swedenborg, was also present. swedenborg’s purpose was to persuade the king to fund an observatory in northern sweden. however, the king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint swedenborg assessor extraordinary on the swedish board of mines (bergskollegium) in stockholm. for the next 30 years, swedenborg’s main work was concentrated in the swedish metal mining industry. his engineering skill earned him a wide reputation. from 1716 to 1718, swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled daedalus hyperboreus (the northern daedalus), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. one notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had already been sketching a few years earlier. in 1718, he published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations or “tremulations”. in 1719, the family name was changed to swedenborg when the family was ennobled. the flying machine, sketched in swedenborg’s notebook from 1714. in 1721, swedenborg issued a voluminous work in which he attempted to demonstrate the geometrical character of physics and chemistry. he spent the next 13 years researching and writing a three volume work on the nature of physics, opera philosophica et mineralia, published at leipzig in 1734, where he tries to conjoin philosophy and metallurgy. he conceived of the atom as a particle vortex, each particle being composed of its own inner motions. this theory approximated the electron nucleus framework of the atom in modern physics. in 1724, he was offered the chair of mathematics at uppsala university, but he declined and said that he had mainly dealt with geometry, chemistry and metallurgy during his career. he also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, which forced him to speak slowly and carefully. moreover, there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public. during the 1730s, swedenborg undertook many studies of anatomy and physiology. he had the first anticipation, as far as known, of the neuron concept. it was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. he also had prescient ideas about the cerebral cortex, the hierarchical organization of the nervous system, the localization of the cerebrospinal fluid, the functions of the pituitary gland, the perivascular spaces, and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. in some cases his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times. in the late 1730s swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory which would explain how matter relates to spirit. swedenborg’s desire to understand the order and purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. in the principia (1734) he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means whereby the inner order of the world can be known), and the power of reason. in the same year he published de infinito (on the infinite), where he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite, and how the soul is connected to the body. he was aware that it might clash with established theologies, since he presents the view that the soul is based on material substances. in 1743, at age 55, swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. his purpose was to gather source material for regnum animale (the animal kingdom, or kingdom of life), in which he aimed to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. he had planned to produce a total of seventeen volumes. beginning in 1743 and continuing throughout 1744, swedenborg experienced intense dreams and visions at night, which he recorded in his personal diary. many of them revolved around a sense of spiritual unworthiness, a feeling that he had to purify himself of sin. although not a theologian in the strict sense, he was an outstanding philosopher or theological speculator. utilizing some basic christian truths, swedenborg elaborated, partly on a scientific basis, partly on a philosophical basi, a theory of god, of man, and of divine revelation and redemption. on the basis of these theorizings, the church of the new jerusalem was founded in 1784. in 1747, he refused a promotion that had been offered to him, instead petitioning the king to be released from his service on the board of mines so he could devote himself full time to theological writing. he took up afresh his study of hebrew and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. he devoted all his energy to  complete his opus magnum, arcana cœlestia (secrets of heaven) as the basis of his further theological works. the work was originally was published anonymously in eight volumes between 1749 and 1756, and swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. it attracted only little attention, as few people were able to understand its meaning. although swedenborg intended to go through every verse of the entire bible, he never did so. instead, he continued his publications with heaven and hell, a description of the afterlife and the lives of its inhabitants; other planets, which describes the beings that live on other planets; last judgment and new jerusalem. there, he writes that the last judgment is not a future event that will mark the end of our world, but a spiritual event where evil spirits who had managed to infiltrate heaven were cast down to hell, allowing human beings on earth and in heaven to receive spiritual truths more clearly. swedenborg passed away on march 29, 1772, in london, in the aftermath of a stroke from which he never fully recovered. his visions and religious ideas have been a source of inspiration for a number of prominent writers, including honoré de balzac, charles baudelaire, ralph waldo emerson, william butler yeats, and august strindberg. at yovisto

       " 'jethro tull and the agricultural revolution.  jethro tull.  on march 30, 1674, english agricultural pioneer jethro tull was baptized. he perfected a horse drawn seed drill in 1701 that economically sowed the seeds in neat rows. he later developed a horse drawn hoe. tull’s methods were adopted by many great land owners and helped to provide the basis for modern agriculture. this revolutionized the future of agricultural success. jethro tull matriculated at st john’s college, oxford at the age of 17 in order to study law but it is assumed that he did not earn a degree. he was called to the bar by the benchers of gray’s inn in december 1693. unfortunately, he became sick very soon with a pulmonary disorder and travelled across europe in search of a cure. it is believed that he spent quite some time in italy and the south of france, especially montpellier. there, tull began to compare the agriculture with that of his own country. tull noted the similarity of his own horse hoe husbandry to the practice followed by the vine dressers in the observed regions, constantly hoeing or otherwise stirring their ground. he developed the theory that manuring soil was not necessary and came back to england to practice his new findings on the farm called prosperous in berkshire. around 1701, tull made early advances in planting crops with his seed drill. the mechanical seeder sowed at the at the correct depth and spacing. the next version of the seed drill was much lighter and more efficient. further, it is assumed that jethro tull was the first to promote the advantages of hoeing cultivated soils. he explained to the farmers that even in the driest weather good hoeing may help to procure moisture to the roots of plants. jethro tull died in 1741 at prosperous farm. due to his work on agriculture, a new movement was initiated called horse hoeing husbandry. at yovisto, you can learn more about ‘the future of irrigated agriculture: where is the water?‘ in a lecture at the university of berkeley.\\n',\n",
       " 'the psychologist must study mankind from the historical or comparative standpoint – moritz lazarus.  moritz lazarus and nahilda lazarus remy ca.1895.  on september 15, 1824, german philosopher and psychologist moritz lazarus was born. he held that humanity must be studied from the historical, comparative viewpoint, analyzing the elements that constitute the fabric of society, with its customs, its conventions, and the main tendencies of its evolution. he was jewish and a leading opponent of anti semitism in his time. moritz lazarus received a jewish education, taking classes in hebrew literature and history until moving to study at a national prussian school when he was about 9 years old. moritz‘ father was an expert in prussian law and served as a rabbinic judge in the local beth din. he represented the citizens in their connections with the authorities. also he educated his son moritz in prussian law, but later insisted that the young lazarus specialized in merchandizing in the house of an acquaintance in the city of posen. in berlin, he continued with his philosophical studies and also learned more about the ritual of german language and cultures. it is assumed that lazarus got really caught in the spirit of the revolution and wakened his patriotic feelings towards prussia and the prussian culture. lazarus even published his work “the moral priority of prussians in germany” in 1850.  along with his colleague steinthal, lazarus established the magazine “zeitschrift für völkerpsychologie und sprachwissenschaft” and simultaneously he started to print his trilogy of research called “the life of the soul“. it deals with the principal problems of psychology from the standpoint of the philosophy of herbart. written in a popular and easy style, it soon found a large circle of readers. two years later the second part was published and in this book, lazarus discussed the relationship between thinking and speaking, as well as how languages were born and developed, and how they create the collective soul in the nations. in 1861, lazarus moved another step further and strengthened his analogy between individual research and the collective soul: there is a so called ‘national soul‘ which is greater than the total number of individual souls. the language is the most significant representation of the national soul, and there exists a dual influence between the individual and the collective soul. he said, that it is possible to understand the rules of the human soul and from it the collective soul. the national soul always exists in the individual soul. in 1860 lazarus was asked to be an honorary professor without pay at the small university of bern, switzerland. lazarus‘ chances of being able to get a university position at a german university were very low because he was jewish. however, the scientist had no financial worries and he chose to accept the position. it is believed that lazarus became the first professor of psychology in any university worldwide. he was quite successful in bern, his lectures were always full and it is known that the audiences were the leaders of swiss society and serving diplomats. during his time at the university, lazarus also spread his belief that women needed to be better included in research and philosophy. even though, lazarus seemed to fit in very well in bern, he had to return to berlin in 1867, where he became more involved with the issues of the jewish community in the city. in berlin, he tried to promote a new, activist opinion claiming that jews need to fight against anti semitism, for equality and emancipation actively. in his article was heißt national?, lazarus claimed that the strength of germany was in her multi culturalness including her jews. he spoke on behalf of german unification and nationalism and asked his jewish brothers to remain faithful to these german values. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lecture titled “thinking and talking about the self” by john perry at berkeley.\\n',\n",

       " ' skinner and radical behaviorism.   skinner at the harvard psychology department, c.\\u20091950.  on march 20, 1904, american psychologist, behaviorist, author, inventor, and social philosopher burrhus frederic (b. f.) skinner was born. his pioneering work in experimental psychology promoted behaviorism, shaping behavior through positive and negative reinforcement and demonstrated operant conditioning. the “skinner box” he used in experiments from 1930 remains famous. burrhus frederic skinner was born march 20, 1904. skinner grew up in a small town in pennsylvania as the son of a lawyer. skinner received his ba in english from hamilton college in upstate new york. the young man wanted to become a writer badly. he authored several poems and short stories and built himself a study in his parents’ attic to concentrate, but it just wasn’t working out for him. after some time, skinner decided to go back to school, studying psychology at harvard university and receiving his doctorate in 1931. for five years, skinner continued his research at harvard. in the next ten years, skinner taught and researched at several universities across the united states before returning to harvard in 1948, where he remained for the rest of his life. during his research, skinner noticed that classical conditioning did not account for the behavior most of us are interested in, such as riding a bike or writing a book. his observations led him to propose a theory about how these and similar behaviors, called operants, come about. in operant conditioning, an operant is actively emitted and produces changes in the world that alter the likelihood that the behavior will occur again. operant conditioning has two basic purposes, increasing or decreasing the probability that a specific behavior will occur in the future. they are accomplished by adding or removing one of two basic types of stimuli, positive pleasant or negative aversive. that means, if the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the presentation of a stimulus, that stimulus is a positive reinforcer and vise versa, if the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the withdrawal of a stimulus, that stimulus is a negative reinforcer. the famous skinner box has a bar or pedal on one wall that, when pressed (for example by rats), causes a little mechanism to release a food pellet into the cage. so when the rat is put in the cage and it (probably accidentally) presses the bar for the first time, a food pellet falls into the cage. the operant in this scenario is the behavior just prior to the reinforcer, which is the food pellet, of course. the rat is now furiously peddling away at the bar, hoarding his pile of pellets in the corner of the cage. a behavior followed by a reinforcing stimulus results in an increased probability of that behavior occurring in the future. if the rat is not given any more pellets when pressing the bar, it will stop doing so, which is called extinction of the operant behavior. then however, if the pellet machine is turned back on, the rat will learn the behavior much more quickly than the first time. by controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response, punishment, and so on. at yovisto, you may be interested in the video lecture what positive psychology can help you become by martin seligman.\\n',\n",
       " 'the watches of daniel quare.  bracket clock by daniel quare on display at the walker art gallery, liverpool image: wikimedia user racklever on march 21, 1724, english clockmaker and instrument maker daniel quare passed away. he is best known for his invention of a repeating watch movement in 1680 and a portable barometer in 1695.   daniel quare was probably born in 1648, but the sources differ. he was admitted a brother of the clockmakers’ company in april 1671. when quare started his career, the pendulum was a novelty just as much as the spiral spring and anchor escapement invented by robert hooke, and the fusee chain. daniel quare is believed to have invented the repeating watches and it is claimed that he adapted the concentric minute hand. however, if daniel quare was really the inventor of all these things, he must have come up with the ideas quite early in his career, as two concentric hands are shown in a diagram in christopher huyghens’s ‘horologium oscillatorium,’ paris, 1673. the clocks and watches made by quare with only one hand are extant, or with two circles and pointers, one for the hours and another for the minutes. when in 1687 edward booth, alias barlow, applied for a patent for ‘pulling or repeating clocks and watches,’ the clockmakers’ company successfully opposed the application on the ground that the alleged invention was anticipated by a watch previously invented and made by quare. the latter’s watch was superior to barlow’s, because it repeated both the hour and the quarter with one pressure, while barlow’s required two. it is believed that quare also made watched for james ii. and william iii., but the sources are apparently not very reliable on these facts. however, he most certainly made a clock for the king which went for a year without rewinding. being specially made for a bedroom, it did not strike. in 1695, a patent was granted to quare for a portable barometer. the barometer, in the words of the patent, ‘may be removed and carried to any place, though turned upside down, without spilling one drop of the quicksilver or letting any air into the tube, and yet nevertheless the air shall have the same liberty to operate upon it as on those common ones now in use with respect to the weight of the atmosphere‘. however, none of these said barometers are known to exist.   at yovisto, you may be interested in a video illustrating watch making.\\n',\n",

       " 'the expeditions of john wesley powell.  john powell with tau gu, a paiute.  on march 24, 1834, american geologist and ethnologist john wesley powell was born. he published the first classification of american indian languages and was the first director of the  bureau of ethnology. he is famous for the 1869 powell geographic expedition, a three month river trip down the green and colorado rivers, including the first known passage through the grand canyon. john powell was born in mount morris, new york, in 1834. his family had emigrated from england four years prior and later on moved to illinois. the young man studied at illinois college, illinois institute, and oberlin college. he also started teacherin but didn’t earn a degree. he learned latin and ancient greek, but his main interest was devoted to natural sciences which was against the wished of his father. in 1860, powell went on a lecture tour and realized that the american civil war was starting, he began to study military science and engineering to prepare himself for the conflict.  he explored wisconsin, illinois, iowa, and the iron mountain regions of missouri, collecting shells, minerals, and general natural history objects, which led to his election in 1859 to the secretaryship of the illinois natural history society. it is said that, in 1856, the only 22 year old man descended the mississippi by himself in a rowboat from the falls of st. anthony to its mouth, making collections on the way. 1857, he possibly rowed the whole length of the ohio river from pittsburg to its mouth, and in 1858 made a life trip down the illinois river to its mouth and thence up the des moines .  during the civil war, john powell as enlisted in the 20th illinois volunteers in the position of second lieutenant. he took part in the battle of shiloh, losing his right arm at pittsburg landing. however, powell returned to the war and fought in the battles of champion hill and black river bridge. after the civil war, john powell left his service as major and accepted the position of professor of geology and curator of the museum of the illinois wesleyan university at bloomington. he also became connected with the illinois normal university and was widely known throughout the state by his lectures and addresses on scientific subjects.  on may 24, 1869, john powell and nine further men left for a 10 months journey into the rocky mountains and around the green and colorado rivers. with four boats, they set out from green river, wyoming, passing down the green river to its confluence with the colorado river near present day moab, utah, and completed the journey on august 30, 1869. after only one month in the expedition, one man already quit and three further men left at separation canyon during the third month. unfortunately, these three men disappeared, which remains a mystery up to this day. in 1871, john powell retraced part of the 1869 route with another expedition traveling from green river, wyoming to kanab creek in the grand canyon. as a result of the expedition, photographs have been published along with maps and papers. however, it was noticed that these maps were not too precise. in preparation of the expedition, jacob hamblin, a mormon missionary in southern utah and northern arizona was employed. he was known to have developed good relationships with native americans. he was asked by powell to work as a negotiator in order to ensure their safety from local native american groups. powell mentioned that he believed the three missing men were killed by the native americans due to mistaken identities. john powell’s subsequent geological descriptions of the explored region introduced an entire new branch of geology called geomorphology. in his publications, powell described his theories of the role of stream flows in wearing down mountains and creating river valleys, which established him as a nationally recognized geologist. due to his recognition and his ability to talk with politicians, powell was appointed the second director of the united states geological survey in 1881. however, it is believed that due to his insistence on putting truth before politics eventually earned him powerful enemies. some of his enemies were very eager to exploit the natural resources of the west, objecting to powell’s insistence on understanding the natural science of the region before developing it. john powell was pushed out of his position in 1894 and continued his scientific work within the bureau of american ethnology.  at yovisto you can learn more about native americans in the 19th century in a video discussion at berkeley university.\\n',\n",
       " 'seymour r. cray – the father of supercomputing.  cray 1 with exposed interiors.  on september 28, 1925, american electrical engineer and supercomputer architect seymour roger cray was born. he designed a series of computers that were the fastest in the world for decades, and founded cray research which built many of these machines. called “the father of supercomputing,” cray has been credited with creating the supercomputer industry. seymour cray was born in 1925 in chippewa falls, wisconsin, a small town situated in the heart of wisconsin’s dairy farm country, to seymour r. and lillian cray. his father was a civil engineer who fostered cray’s interest in science and engineering. as early as the age of ten he was able to build a device out of erector set components that converted punched paper tape into morse code signals. the basement of the family home was given over to the young cray as a “laboratory”. cray graduated from chippewa falls high school in 1943 before being drafted for world war ii as a radio operator. he saw action in europe, and then moved to the pacific theatre where he worked on breaking japanese naval codes. on his return to the  he received a c. in electrical engineering at the university of minnesota, graduating in 1949. he also was awarded a c. in applied mathematics in 1951. in 1950, cray joined engineering research associates (era) in saint paul, minnesota. era had formed out of a former united states navy lab that had built code breaking machines, a tradition era carried on when such work was available. era was introduced to computer technology during one such effort, but in other times had worked on a wide variety of basic engineering as well. there, cray quickly came to be regarded as an expert on digital computer technology, especially following his design work on the era 1103, one of the first commercially successful scientific computer. he remained at era when it was bought by remington rand and then sperry corporation in the early 1950s. at the newly formed sperry rand, era became the “scientific computing” arm of their univac division. in 1957, a number of employees of the scientific computer division left to form control data corporation (cdc). cray joined the new company later and by 1960 he had completed the design of the cdc 1604, an improved low cost era 1103 that had impressive performance for its price range. cray did not enjoy working on traditional business computers constrained to design for low cost construction, so cdc could sell lots of them. his desire was to produce the fastest computer in the world. although in terms of hardware his design of the cdc 6600 was not on the leading edge, cray invested considerable effort in an attempt to enable it to run as fast as possible. unlike most high end projects, cray realized that there was considerably more to performance than simple processor speed, that i/o bandwidth had to be maximized as well in order to avoid “starving” the processor of data to crunch. as he later noted, anyone can build a fast cpu. the trick is to build a fast system. the cdc 6600 was the first commercial supercomputer, the first to employ freon to cool its 350000 transistors, outperforming everything then available by a wide margin. while expensive, for those that needed the absolutely fastest computer available there was nothing else on the market that could compete. cray continued to design further supercomputers for cdc, such as the cdc 7600 and cdc 8600, but the supercomputer projects had almost bankrupted the company while they were being designed and cray decided to start his own company cray research in 1972. the first cray 1 system was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 for $8.8 million. it boasted a world record speed of 160 million floating point operations per second (160 megaflops) and an 8 megabyte main memory. the cray 1‘s architecture reflected its designer’s penchant for bridging technical hurdles with revolutionary ideas. in order to increase the speed of this system, the cray 1 had a unique “c” shape which enabled integrated circuits to be closer together. no wire in the system was more than four feet long. to handle the intense heat generated by the computer, cray developed an innovative refrigeration system using freon . in order to concentrate his efforts on design, cray left the ceo position in 1980 and became an independent contractor. the cray 2 system appeared in 1985, providing a tenfold increase in performance over the cray 1. in 1988, cray research introduced the cray y mp, the world’s first supercomputer to sustain over 1 gigaflop on many applications. multiple 333 mflops processors powered the system to a record sustained speed of 2.3 gigaflops. always a visionary, seymour cray had been exploring the use of gallium arsenide in creating a semiconductor faster than silicon. however, the costs and complexities of this material made it difficult for the company to support both the cray 3 and the cray c90 development efforts. in 1989, cray research spun off the cray 3 project into a separate company, cray computer corporation, headed by seymour cray and based in colorado springs, colorado. tragically, seymour cray died of injuries suffered in an auto accident in september 1996 at the age of 71. cray had always resisted the massively parallel solution to high speed computing, offering a variety of reasons that it would never work as well as one very fast processor. he famously quipped “if you were plowing a field, which would you rather use: two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?” by the mid 1990s this argument was becoming increasingly difficult to justify, and modern compiler technology made developing programs on such machines not much more difficult than their simpler counterparts at yovisto, you can listen to a panel discussion about the 30th anniversary of the first cray supercomputer.\\n',\n",
       " 'joseph proust and the law of constant composition.  joseph proust (1754-1826). on september 26, 1754, french chemist joseph louis proust was born. he was best known for his discovery of the law of constant composition in 1799, stating that in chemical reactions matter is neither created nor destroyed. joseph l. proust was born on september 26, 1754 in angers, france as the second son of joseph proust, an apothecary, and rosalie sartre. joseph studied chemistry in his father’s shop and later came to paris, where he studied chemistry with hilaire martin rouelle. in 1776 proust was appointed a pharmacist at the salpêtrière hospital in paris. he published his first papers while at this hospital. however, his position was short lived, for in 1778 proust abandoned pharmacy to take a professorship of chemistry at the recently established seminario patriótico vascongado in vergara, spain. this school was the creation of the real sociedad económica vascongada de amigos del país, the first and most important of the “enlightened” provincial societies in spain. in 1780 proust returned to paris, where he taught chemistry at the musée, a private teaching institution founded by scientific impresario and aeronaut jean françois pilâtre de rozier. part of this association involved proust with aerostatic experiments, which culminated in a balloon ascent with pilâtre on june 23, 1784, at versailles, in the presence of the king and queen of france, the king of sweden, and the french court. in 1786 proust returned to spain to teach chemistry, first at madrid and then in 1788 at the royal artillery school in segovia. founded in 1764, this school was part of the program of the government of charles iii to bring spain abreast of the northern european countries regarding military training. because of spain’s scientific backwardness, expert instructors had to be sought abroad and proust had been recommended by no less than the great french chemist antoine laurent de lavoisier. but when napoleon invaded spain, they burned proust’s laboratory and forced him back to france. proust is best known for two major advances in analytical chemistry. first, he developed the use of hydrogen sulfide as a reagent (a substance used to detect the presence of other substances by the chemical reactions it causes). hydrogen sulfide is a colorless, extremely poisonous gas with a sweetish taste and a strong odor of rotten eggs. chemical compounds containing sulfur produce hydrogen sulfide when they react with certain other chemical compounds. this is why the odor of hydrogen sulfide can be detected around decaying organic matter. hydrogen sulfide is flammable and burns with a pale blue flame. chemists make hydrogen sulfide in the laboratory by combining such strong acids as hydrochloric acid with such metal sulfides as iron sulfide. they use the gas to analyze the composition of mixtures and to produce other compounds. his second achievement derived from a controversy with  berthollet on the law of definite proportions, which is sometimes also known as proust’s law. proust studied copper carbonate, the two tin oxides, and the two iron sulfides to prove this law. he did this by making artificial copper carbonate and comparing it to natural copper carbonate. with this he showed that each had the same proportion of weights between the three elements involved . between the two types of the other compounds, proust showed that no intermediate compounds exist between them. proust published this paper in 1794, and his famous opponent berthollet did not believe that substances always combine in constant and definite proportions. moreover, bethollet claimed that that the products of a reaction depend on the ratio of reactants. proust’s law was not accepted until 1812, when the swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius gave him credit for it. although proust was correct in his observations, the reason why reagents behave in the way he described did not become clear until english chemist john dalton formulated his atomic theory in 1803. according to dalton, a fixed number of atoms of one substance always combined with a fixed number of atoms of another substance in forming a compound. dalton realized that substances must combine in the same proportions by weight as the weight proportions of their atoms. other chemists had already observed that pure substances do combine in fixed proportions. they called that finding the law of definite (or constant) proportions. dalton’s theory explained the law. proust also performed a series of researches to characterize different types of sugars, present in vegetable products. after the death of his wife in 1817, proust moved to angers, where in 1820 he took over the pharmacy of his brother joachim. in 1819 he became a chevalier of the legion of honor, and in 1820 he was granted a pension by louis xviii.  on july 5, 1826 he died in angers, france. at yovisto, you can earn a better understanding

       " 'abraham werner and the school of neptunism.  abraham gottlob werner (1749-1817). on september 25, 1749, german geologist abraham gottlob werner was born. he is best known for his early theory about the stratification of the earth’s crust. moreover, he propounded an earth history that others labeled neptunism that states that holding that all rocks have aqueous origins. while most tenets of neptunism were eventually set aside, science is indebted to werner for clearly demonstrating the chronological succession of rocks, for the zeal which he infused into his pupils, and for the impulse which he thereby gave to the study of geology. thus, he has been called the “father of german geology.” abraham gottlob werner was born in wehrau (now osiecznica, lower silesian voivodeship), a village in prussian silesia, as second child, and only son. his family had been involved in the mining industry for many years, where his father, abraham david werner, was an inspector at the duke of solm’s ironworks. wernerwas educated at freiberg and leipzig, where he studied law and mining after working with his father for five years in the ironworks at wehrau and lorzendorf. while in leipzig, werner became interested in the systematic identification and classification of minerals. within a year he published the first modern textbook on descriptive mineralogy, von den äusserlichen kennzeichen der fossilien (on the external characters of fossils, or of minerals; 1774). during his career, he discovered eight minerals and named 26. in 1775 he was then appointed as inspector and teacher of mining and mineralogy at the small, but influential, freiberg mining academy. during his 40-year tenure, the school grew from a local academy into a world renowned centre of scientific learning. werner was a brilliant lecturer and a man of great charm, and his genius attracted students who, inspired by him, became the foremost geologists of europe. a distinguishing feature of werner’s teaching was the care with which he taught the study of rocks and minerals and the orderly succession of geological formations, a subject that he called geognosy. influenced by the works of johann gottlob lehmann and georg christian füchsel, werner demonstrated that the rocks of the earth are deposited in a definite order. although he had never travelled, he assumed that the sequence of the rocks he observed in saxony was the same for the rest of the world. in the 18th century, rocks were explained in terms of the biblical flood, and were classified into three categories that most people associated with the biblical flood: “primary” for ancient rocks without fossils (believed to precede the flood), “secondary” for rocks containing fossils (often attributed to the flood itself) and “tertiary” for sediments believed to have been deposited after the flood. werner didn’t overturn the commonly held belief in the biblical flood, but he did recognize a different group of rocks that didn’t fit this classification: rocks with a few fossils that were younger than primary rocks but older than secondary rocks. he called these “transition” rocks. during his career, werner published very little, but his fame as a teacher spread throughout europe, attracting students, who became virtual disciples, and spread his interpretations throughout their homelands. socratic in his lecturing style, werner developed an appreciation for the broader implications and interrelations of geology within his students, who provided an enthusiastic and attentive audience. werner theorized that at one time the earth had been completely covered with oceans and that as sediments and chemicals in the water fell to the ocean floor, they formed layers of rock, which eventually became the land. over time, water from the ocean evaporated, exposing the land and leaving pockets of water in low lying areas. werner’s ideas had many followers and they came to be known as neptunists, after neptune, the roman god of the water. but werner’s theory was not without opposition. scottish geologist james hutton had a much different theory. hutton led a group known as the plutonists, named for pluto, the roman god of the underworld. the plutonists held that rock formed with the aid of heat instead of water. during the late 1700’s, there was a great deal of debate in the scientific community as to which group was correct. although some of hutton’s ideas were later modified, scientists in the early 1800’s were able to prove that his theory was more accurate, and werner’s neptunism was discredited. one criticism of this hypothesis was that werner hadn’t traveled enough to verify it. however, neptunism certainly had its attractions, with werner’s disciples distributed all over europe. the advantages of the theory were that it was theologically acceptable, it was simple, and it showed how the earth could be formed in the short time available. werner was also a mineralogist and he constructed a new classification of minerals. there was a major split among 18th century mineralogists as to whether minerals should be classified according to their external form (the natural method) or by their chemical composition (the chemical method). werner finally adopted, in 1817, a mixed set of criteria by which he divided minerals into four main classes – earthy, saline, combustible, and metallic. he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1810. werner was plagued by frail health his entire life, and passed a quiet existence in the immediate environs of freiberg. he died at dresden as a bachelor in 1817, from internal complications said to have been caused by his consternation over the misfortunes that had befallen saxony during the napoleonic wars. at yovisto you can learn more about basic geology in the lecture of aida awan ‘introduction to geology 01‘.\\n',\n",

(please skip the rest of the paragraph, if you don’t want to spoil your reading experience…) they marry, but only after rochester’s insane first wife of whom jane initially had no knowledge dies in a dramatic fire. in jane eyre charlotte transformed her very own experiences into a novel with universal appeal. commercially it was an instant success, and initially received favourable reviews. the book’s style was innovative, combining naturalism with gothic melodrama, and broke new ground in being written from an intensely first person female perspective. speculation about the identity of currer bell and whether the author was male or female heightened with the publication of emily‘s wuthering heights by “ellis bell” and anne‘s agnes grey by “acton bell“. following the success of jane eyre, in 1848 charlotte began work on the manuscript of her second novel, shirley, when the brontë household suffered a tragic series of events. in september 1848 branwell died, when emily became seriously ill and died of pulmonary tuberculosis. one year later in 1849, anne died of the same disease. nevertheless, charlotte resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief and finished shirley which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society was published in october 1849. before the publication of charlotte’s third novel villette, she received a marriage proposal from arthur bell nicholls, her father‘s curate who had long been in love with her. after initially turning down this proposal, she accepted in 1854 and got married. charlotte became pregnant soon after the marriage but her health declined rapidly. she died with her unborn child on 31 march 1855, aged 38. at yovisto you can learn more about charlotte brontë’s most famous novel ‘jane eyre’ in a lecture at dld college, london.\\n',\n",

i doubt. but, let’s have a look at edison‘s invention of the movie industry. the works and ideas of photographic pioneer eadweard muybridge appear to have spurred thomas a. edison to pursue the development of a motion picture system. on february 25, 1888, in orange, new jersey, muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his zoopraxiscope, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. two days later, muybridge and edison met at edison‘s laboratory in west orange to talk about a collaboration to join muybridge‘s device with the edison phonograph — a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. but, the collaboration never happened. moreover, in october 1888, edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the  patent office announcing his plans to create a device that would do “for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear”. in march 1889, a second caveat followed, which gave a name to the proposed motion picture device, the kinetoscope, derived from the greek roots kineto- (“movement“) and scopos (“to view”). edison assigned dickson, one of his most talented employees, to the job of making the kinetoscope a reality. edison‘s original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 of an inch wide, directly on to a cylinder with a synchronized audio cylinder for sound recording. although expanded in later testing, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. thus, they tried sensitized celluloid sheets wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. the first film made for the kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the , may have been shot at this time, known as monkeyshines, no. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue in cheek display of physical dexterity. attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind. a trip of edison‘s to europe and the exposition universelle in paris in 1889 gave edison new ideas for the realization of his kinetoscope. there, he met scientist photographer étienne jules marey, who had devised a “chronophotographic gun“, the first portable motion picture camera. he also came across early european film pioneers like french inventor charles-émile reynaud, who used images painted on gelatine frames as well as german inventor ottamar anschütz. their crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily “freeze” the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer‘s retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. by early 1891, however, edison‘s team had succeeded in devising a functional strip based film viewing system. in the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19 mm (3/4 inch) film ran around a series of spindles. the film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. the lab also developed a motor powered camera, the kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. on may 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the national federation of women‘s clubs. the new york sun described what the club women saw in the “small pine box” they encountered: in the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. as they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. it was a most marvelous picture. it bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. every motion was perfect…on april 14, 1894, the first commercial exhibition of motion pictures in history was given in new york city, using ten kinetoscopes. this can be considered the birth of american movie culture. at yovisto you can watch some of the early kinetoscope productions from edison’s filmstudios from the years 1894-1896.\\n',\n",
       " 'catherine de medici and st. bartholomew’s day.  catherine and henry‘s marriage.  on april 13, 1519, italian noblewoman and queen of france catherine de’ medici was born. catherine played a key role in the reign of her sons, and is blamed for the excessive persecutions of the hugenots in particular for the st. bartholomew‘s day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of huguenots were killed in paris and throughout france. catherine de’ medici was born into a very influential family. her father was made duke of urbino by his uncle pope leo x and her mother was from one of the most prominent and ancient french noble families. unfortunately, her parents passed away early, wherefore she grew up with further family members. however, the family’s power decreased in 1527 and pope clement had to crown charles holy roman emperor. charles‘ troops laid siege to florence and catherine was supposed to be killed or exposed naked and chained to the city walls. the city surrendered in 1530 and clement had catherine move to rome. when francis i of france offered that his second son, henry, duke of orléans, would marry catherine and clement highly supported the wedding. it took place in 1533, but the 14-year old’s saw only little of each other during their first year of marriage. also it is assumed, that prince henry showed only little interest in his wife at all and for a quite long time they failed to produce any children. unfortunately, henry‘s mistress gave birth to a daughter, which proved that he was fertile. he openly acknowledged her and added much pressure on catherine. after quite a while, divorce was even discussed and catherine now tried anything to get pregnant and in 1544, she finally gave birth to a son. the couples marriage did not improve after having several children, but catherine was still respected as henry‘s consort. after the death of king francis i, she became the queen consort of france and was crowned in the basilica of saint denis. however, catherine‘s political power was very limited and henry gave the château of chenonceau, which catherine had wanted for herself, to diane de poitiers, who took her place at the center of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours. after a sport accident, king henry first lost his sight and speech and passed away on 10 july, 1559. francis ii became king at the age of fifteen and catherine was not strictly entitled to a role in francis‘s government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself. still, it is assumed that she played a major role in his decision making. when her son died in 1560, catherine was appointed govenor of france and the nine year old charles ix became king, who cried during his coronation. on 1 march 1562, in an incident known as the massacre of vassy, the duke of guise and his men attacked worshipping huguenots in a barn at vassy, killing 74 and wounding 104. guise, who called the massacre “a regrettable accident“, was cheered as a hero in the streets of paris while the huguenots called for revenge. the massacre lit the fuse that sparked the french wars of religion. for the next thirty years, france found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce. louis de bourbon, prince of condé raised a large army, formed an alliance with england and started seizing town after town in france. after further conflicts with her allies as well as her enemies, catherine now rallied hugenot and catholic forces to retake le havre from england. when charles ix was declared of age, he still showed only little interest in government and catherine decided to enforce the edict of amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. philip ii sent the duke of alba to tell catherine to scrap the edict of amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy. in 1566, charles ix of france and catherine de medicis unsuccessfully proposed to the ottoman court a plan to resettle french huguenots and french and german lutherans in ottoman controlled moldavia. in 1570, charles ix married the daughter of maximilian ii, holy roman emperor. catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and elizabeth i of england. after elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, catherine had touted her youngest daughter margaret as a bride for philip ii of spain. now she sought a marriage between margaret and henry iii of navarre, with the aim of uniting valois and bourbon interests. margaret, however, was secretly involved with henry of guise, the son of the late duke of guise and she faced great problems when catherine found out about it. when admiral coligny was shot and wounded through his window, catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to coligny and promised to punish his attacker. many historians have blamed catherine for the attack. two days later, the st. bartholomew‘s day massacre took place. it stained catherine‘s reputation ever since, since there is no reason to believe she was not party to the decision when on 23 august charles ix ordered, “then kill them all! kill them all!”. catherine and her advisers expected a huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on coligny. they chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the huguenot leaders while they were still in paris after the wedding of henry and catherine‘s daughter margaret. the massacre lasted for almost one week and spread across france where it persisted into the fall. at yovisto, you may be interested in a video lectureby barbara diefendorf on ‘the saint

       " 'juan de la cierva and the autogiro.  demonstration of cierva  autogiro at farnborough, oct. 1925.  on september 21, 1895, spanish civil engineer and aviation pioneer juan de la cierva y codorníu was born. his most famous accomplishment was the invention in 1920 of the autogiro, a single rotor type of aircraft, a predecessor of today‘s helicopter. juan de la cierva was born in murcia, spain to a wealthy family. although trained as a civil engineer, cierva became interested in aviation early in his youth. after several successful experiments with aviation as a boy, he eventually earned a civil engineering degree. for six years he attended the escuela especial de ingenieros de caminos, canales y puertos in madrid, spain, where he studied theoretical aerodynamics. following this, he entered a competition to design military aircraft for the government and built a biplane bomber with an airfoil (the part of a plane that provides lift) that he designed mathematically. the plane was tested in may 1919, but it crashed when the pilot stalled it. cierva believed that fixed wing aircraft were unsafe, so he experimented with a rotary wing design. in 1919 he started to consider the use of a rotor to generate lift at low airspeed, and eliminate the risk of stall. in order to achieve this, he utilized the ability of a lifting rotor to autorotate, whereby at a suitable pitch setting, a rotor will continue to rotate without mechanical drive, sustained by the torque equilibrium of the lift and drag forces acting on the blades. this phenomenon was already known, and was available as a safety feature to allow controlled descent of a helicopter in the event of engine failure. with de la cierva‘s autogiro, the rotor was drawn through the air by means of conventional propeller, with the result that the rotor generated sufficient lift to sustain level flight, climb and descent. before this could be satisfactorily achieved, de la cierva experienced several failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take off, due to dissymmetry of lift between the advancing and retreating blades. this major difficulty was resolved by the introduction of the flapping hinge. in 1923, de la cierva‘s first successful autogiro was flown in spain. in a fixed wing aircraft, lift is provided by the wing, thrust by the propeller. cierva, though, believed that the autogiro controlled these forces better than fixed wing aircraft, which had a tendency in those days to stall, or lose lift suddenly. he also wanted to develop an aircraft that needed only a short takeoff run and could slowly land in small areas. the autogiro was a major step toward those goals. in 1925, he demonstrated his autogiro to the british air ministry at farnborough, hampshire, which was a great success, and resulted in an invitation to continue the work in the uk. the same year, de la cierva moved to england where, with the support of scottish industrialist james g. weir, he established the cierva autogiro company. on september 18, 1928, he flew one of his autogiros () across the english channel, and in 1930, he flew one from england to spain. as de la cierva‘s autogiros achieved success and acceptance, others began to follow and with them came further innovation. most important was the development of direct rotor control through cyclic pitch variation, achieved initially by tilting the rotor hub and subsequently by raoul hafner by the application of a spider mechanism that acted directly on each rotor blade. the introduction of jump take off was another major improvement in capability. the rotor was accelerated in no lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then declutched. at the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936, de la cierva supported the forces of francisco franco, while his brother was executed by the republican army in paracuellos del jarama. in a very ironic twist of fate the man who spent the better part of his life to develop a safe aircraft would loose his own life in an aircraft accident. on the morning of 9 december 1936, de la cierva boarded a dutch dc 2 of klm at croydon airfield, bound for amsterdam, which during take off should stall and crash on the roof of a building at the end of the runway. autogiros were used during the 1930s for military liaison, mail delivery, and agricultural purposes. de la cierva’s work on rotor dynamics and control made possible the modern helicopter, whose development as a practical means of flight had been prevented by these problems. at yovisto you can learn more about the history of early helicopters in a short documentary produced for encyclopedia britannica, now part of the prellinger archive on helicopters from 1953.\\n',\n",

       " 'william playfair and the beginnings of infographics.  playfair’s trade balance time series chart, from the commercial and political atlas and statistical breviary, 1786 on september 22, 1759, scottish engineer and political economist william playfair was born. he is generally considered the founder of graphical methods of statistics. william playfair invented four types of diagrams: line graph, bar chart, pie chart, and circle graph. playfair was born in 1759 in scotland during the enlightenment, a golden age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. he was the fourth son of the reverend james playfair of the parish of liff & benvie near the city of dundee in scotland. his notable brothers were architect james playfair and john playfair, professor of mathematics and later professor of natural philosophy at the university of edinburgh. his father died in 1772 when william was 13, leaving the eldest brother john to care for the family and his education. his early taste for mechanics prompted his friends to place him as apprentice to a mill wright andrew meikle, the inventor of the threshing machine. but, this is were william playfair‘s multifaceted career should only start. he was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. in 1780, he went to england, was engaged as draftsman and personal assistant of the inventor james watt at the steam engine manufacturing works of boulton & watt in birmingham in 1777, where he received a scientific and engineering training. among the most useful of his mechanical efforts, was the unrequited discovery of the french telegraph, gathered from a few partial hints, and afterwards adapted by an alphabet of his own invention to british use.  on leaving watt‘s company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in london, which failed. in 1787 he moved to paris, taking part in the storming of the bastille two years later. he returned to london in 1793, where he opened a “security bank“, which also failed. from 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work. playfair‘s main achievement lies primarily in his innovations in the presentation of quantitative information by means of graphs and charts. but, he was not the first to come up with the idea. already in 1765, joseph priestley had created the innovation of the first timeline charts, in which individual bars were used to visualize the life span of a person to compare the life spans of multiple persons. these timelines directly inspired wiliam playfair‘s invention of the bar chart, which first appeared in his commercial and political atlas, published in 1786. actually, playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. he had collected data about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as line graphs. because he lacked the necessary series data for scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year (1781) as a series of bars, one for each of scotland‘s trading partners. playfair‘s pie charts from the commercial and political atlas and statistical breviary, 1786 playfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the line, bar, and pie charts. his time series plots are still presented as models of clarity. playfair first published the commercial and political atlas in london in 1786. it contained 43 time series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work. it has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs. playfair‘s statistical breviary, published in london in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first pie chart. he was the first to use hachure, shading, and color, thus incorporating elements of classification into the quantitative depiction. the quality and detail of his work was such that in the two centuries since there has been no appreciable improvement of his basic designs.  after the bourbon restoration in france, william playfair returned to paris, where he edited a journal called galignani’s messenger. he had to flee the country a second time when prosecuted for libel, and thereafter spent his time writing in london, where he died at the age of 64. playfair has invented a universal language useful to science and commerce alike and though his contemporaries failed to grasp the significance, he had no doubt that he had forever changed the way we would look at data. however, it took almost a century after his death before his invention was fully accepted.  at yovisto you can learn more about the visualization of statistical data in the famous ted talk of prof. hans rosling on ‘let my dataset change your mindset‘.\\n',\n",
       " 'juan bautista de anza and the route to san francisco bay.  juan bautista de anza, from a portrait in oil by fray orsi in 1774.  on march 28, 1776, basque new spanish explorer juan bautista de anza was the first to reach the san francisco bay by land. de anza was the first european to establish an overland route from mexico, through the sonoran desert, to the pacific coast of california. new world spanish explorers had been seeking such a route through the desert southwest for more than two centuries. juan bautista de anza was born in sonora, new spain in 1736. de anza enlisted in the army at the presidio of fronteras in 1752 and became a captain in 1760. de anza proposed an expedition to alta california in the early 1770s. the region had been colonized in the late 1760s and the colonies had been established at san diego and monterey. still, a direct land route was desired and de anza’s mission was apporoved by the king of spain and on january 8, 1774. the expedition including 20 soldiers, and 140 horses was guided by a native american. together they took a southern route along the rio altar, then paralleled the modern mexico california border. the expedition crossed the colorado river at its confluence with the gila river. the expedition was observed by viceroy and king and they decided that de anza should lead a group of colonists to alta california. the expedition arrived at mission san gabriel arcángel in january, 1776 and continued to monterey with the colonists. de anza and 247 colonists arrived at the future site of san francisco on this day in 1776. de anza established a presidio, or military fort, on the tip of the san francisco peninsula. six months later, a spanish franciscan priest founded a mission near the presidio that he named in honor of st. francis of assisi – in spanish, san francisco de asiacutes. however, san francisco remained an isolated settlement for many years after anza founded the first settlement. it is believed that in the 1830s, the potential of the area was eventually realized. back then, san francisco was only a rather small town of 900 people, but after gold had been discovered, more and more settlers came to the city and by the 1850s, it is believed that more than 36.000 people lived there. juan bautista de anza himself was appointed governor of new mexico in 1777. he negotiated a critical peace treaty with commanche indians, who agreed to join the spanish in making war on the apache. he retired in 1786 and passed away two years later. at yovisto you may learn more about native americans in a lecture at berkeley university.\\n']"
